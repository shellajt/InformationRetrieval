cincinnati law school religion unitarian signature william howard taft (september 15 1857 � march 8 1930) was an american jurist and statesman who served as both the 27th president of the united states (1909�1913) and later the 10th chief justice of the united states (1921�1930) a leader during the progressive era taft and his conservative allies took control of the republican party away from theodore roosevelt and the liberals he is the only person to have presided over both the executive and judicial branches of the united states federal government
before becoming president taft served as solicitor general of the united states and as a judge on the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit in 1900 president william mckinley appointed taft governor-general of the philippines in 1904 president theodore roosevelt appointed taft secretary of war in an effort to groom taft then his close political ally into his handpicked presidential successor taft assumed a prominent role in problem solving assuming on some occasions the role of acting secretary of state while declining repeated offers from roosevelt to serve on the supreme court
riding a wave of popular support for fellow republican roosevelt taft won an easy victory in his 1908 bid for the presidency[1] in his only term taft's domestic agenda emphasized trust-busting civil service reform strengthening the interstate commerce commission improving the performance of the postal service and passage of the sixteenth amendment abroad taft sought to further the economic development of nations in latin america and asia through dollar diplomacy and showed decisiveness and restraint in response to revolution in mexico the task-oriented taft was oblivious to the political ramifications of his decisions often alienated his own key constituencies and was overwhelmingly defeated in his bid for a second term in the presidential election of 1912 in surveys of presidential scholars taft is usually ranked near the middle of lists of all american presidents
after leaving office taft spent his time in academia arbitration and the pursuit of world peace through his self-founded league to enforce peace in 1921 president warren g harding appointed taft chief justice of the united states he emphasized conservative policies and efficient management

early life and education yale college photograph of taft william howard taft was born into the powerful taft family on september 15 1857 near cincinnati ohio the son of louisa torrey and alphonso taft[2] his paternal grandfather was peter rawson taft a descendant of robert taft i the first taft in america who settled in colonial mendon in a section known later as uxbridge massachusetts alphonso taft went to cincinnati in 1839 to open a law practice[3] and was a prominent republican who served as secretary of war and attorney general under president ulysses s grant[4]
young william attended cincinnati's first congregational-unitarian church with his parents he joined the congregation at an early age and was an enthusiastic participant as he rose in the government he spent little time in cincinnati he attended the church much less frequently than he had but worshiped there when he could[5]
taft attended woodward high school in cincinnati and laid the cornerstone of the new woodward high school now the site of the school for creative and performing arts (scpa)[6] like others in his family he attended yale college in new haven connecticut[7] at yale he was a member of the linonian society a literary and debating society skull and bones the secret society co-founded by his father alphonso taft in 1832 and the beta chapter of the psi upsilon fraternity he was given the nickname big lub because of his size[8] but his college friends knew him by the nickname old bill[9] while taft's weight sometimes made him the target of jokes barbed comments he usually took them with grace and made self-deprecating jokes despite his size he was a good dancer and a better than average athlete who enjoyed golf tennis and horseback riding[10] making positive use of his stature taft was yale's intramural heavyweight wrestling champion[11] in 1878 taft graduated ranking second in his class out of 121[9] after college he attended cincinnati law school graduating with a bachelor of laws in 1880 while in law school he worked on the area newspaper the cincinnati commercial[9]
legal career and early politics after admission to the ohio bar taft was appointed assistant prosecutor of hamilton county ohio[12] based in cincinnati in 1882 he was appointed local collector of internal revenue[13] taft married his longtime sweetheart helen herron in cincinnati in 1886[12] in 1887 he was appointed a judge of the superior court of cincinnati[12] in 1890 president benjamin harrison appointed him solicitor general of the united states[12] at age 32 he was the youngest-ever solicitor general[14] taft then began serving on the newly created united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit in 1891[12] he was confirmed by the senate on march 17 1892 and received his commission that same day[15] in about 1893 taft decided in favor of the processing aluminum patents belonging to the pittsburgh reduction company now known as alcoa[16] along with his judgeship between 1896 and 1900 taft also served as the first dean and a professor of constitutional law at the university of cincinnati[17]
in 1900 president william mckinley appointed taft chairman of a commission to organize a civilian government in the philippines which had been ceded to the united states by spain following the spanish�american war and the 1898 treaty of paris[12] although taft had been opposed to the annexation of the islands and had told mckinley his real ambition was to become a justice of the supreme court of the united states he reluctantly accepted the appointment[18][19]
from 1901 to 1904 taft served as the first civilian governor-general of the philippines a position in which he was very popular with both americans and filipinos[18] in 1902 taft visited rome to negotiate with pope leo xiii for the purchase of philippine lands owned by the roman catholic church taft then persuaded congress to appropriate more than $7&#160million to purchase these lands which he sold to filipinos on easy terms[18] in 1903 president theodore roosevelt offered taft the seat on the supreme court to which he had for so long aspired but he reluctantly declined since he viewed the filipinos as not yet being capable of governing themselves and because of his popularity among them[18] this decision was one among many in taft's career which demonstrated a compulsive dedication to the job at hand without regard to his self-interest (roosevelt actually made the offer of a seat on the court on several different occasions being met with a decline every time[20]) this dedication to the task at hand was the source of much frustration of his political colleagues[21] according to biographer anderson contrary to the belief of roosevelt and other allies taft's role as governor-general in the philippines did not serve to equip him with the political skills essential for the white house[22]
secretary of war (1904�1908) william howard taft addressing the audience at the philippine assembly in the manila grand opera house in 1904 roosevelt appointed taft as secretary of war[12] this appointment allowed taft to remain involved in the philippines and roosevelt also assured taft he would support his later appointment to the court while taft agreed to support roosevelt in the presidential election of 1904[23] roosevelt made the basic policy decisions regarding military affairs using taft as a well-traveled spokesman who campaigned for roosevelt's reelection in 1904 of taft's appointment roosevelt said if only there were three of you i could appoint one of you to the court one to the war department and one to the philippines [23] taft met with the emperor of japan who alerted him of the probability of war with russia in 1905 taft met with japanese prime minister katsura tar at that meeting the two signed a secret diplomatic memorandum now called the taft�katsura agreement contrary to rumor the memorandum did not establish any new policies but instead repeated the public positions of both nations[24]
on september 29 1906 secretary taft initiated the second occupation of cuba when he established the provisional government of cuba under the terms of the cuban�american treaty of relations of 1903 (the platt amendment) declaring himself provisional governor of cuba[25][26] the us sent troops to restore order in cuba during the revolt led by general enrique loynaz del castillo and taft temporarily became the civil governor of cuba personally negotiating with castillo for a peaceful end to the revolt on october 13 taft was succeeded as provisional governor by charles edward magoon on october 23 president roosevelt issued executive order 518 ratifying the order and ordering magoon to report to taft through the bureau of insular affairs[25]
also in that year roosevelt made his third offer to taft of a position on the court which he again declined out of a sense of duty to resolve pending issues in the philippines had it been for the chief justice seat a different result may well have ensued[27] taft indicated to roosevelt he wanted to be chief justice of the supreme court not president but there was no vacancy and roosevelt had other plans � in 1907 he began touting taft as the best choice for the presidential nomination by the party[27] taft's wife was determined to gain the white house and pressured him not to accept a court appointment other family members also strongly favored the presidency for him he gave taft more responsibilities along with the philippines and the panama canal for a while taft was acting secretary of state when roosevelt was away taft was in effect the acting president
while serving as the war secretary taft generally concentrated on major developments including the philippines and the panama canal to the detriment of departmental housekeeping problems including factionalism within the department of which roosevelt was aware[28] in 1903 the hay�bunau-varilla treaty granted the us construction rights for the panama canal which roosevelt delegated to the war department and taft thereby supervised the beginning of construction on the canal[29] taft promoted a reduction in the tariffs on sugar and tobacco in the philippines a position with which roosevelt disagreed taft offered to resign but this was refused by roosevelt[30] taft also had a disagreement with roosevelt over the latter's conclusion of an executive agreement with the dominican republic in lieu of what taft thought should have been a treaty requiring ratification by the senate roosevelt dismissed the complaint as trifling and taft in his usual style let it go[31]
presidential election of 1908 see also united states presidential election 1908 one of a series of candid photographs known as the evolution of a smile taken just after a formal portrait session while taft learns by telephone from roosevelt that he has been nominated by the republican party for the office of president electoral votes by state 1908 1909 inauguration theodore roosevelt had become president after william mckinley was assassinated in 1901 after getting elected president in his own right in 1904 on election night on the lawn of the white house roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for reelection in 1908 a decision that he immediately regretted but he felt bound by his word taft was the logical successor but he was initially reluctant to run as he had been earlier as a member of roosevelt's cabinet he had declared that his future ambition was to serve on the supreme court not the white house taft's efforts in stumping for the party in the 1906 mid-term elections made him aware of his deficiencies as an effective campaigner mrs taft even commented during this time never did he cease to regard a supreme court appointment as more desirable than the presidency[32] buttaft conceded with his extensive involvement as the most prominent member of the cabinet that he was the most available man[33] thus he agreed that were he to be nominated for president he would put his personal convictions aside and run a vigorous campaign[34]
at the time roosevelt was convinced that taft was a genuine progressive and helped push through the nomination of his secretary of war onto the republican ticket on the first ballot at the party convention[35] his opponent in the general election was william jennings bryan who had already run for president twice before in 1896 and in 1900 against william mckinley during the campaign taft undercut bryan's liberal support by accepting some of his reformist ideas and roosevelt's progressive policies blurred the distinctions between the parties bryan on the other hand ran an aggressive campaign against the nation's business elite the democrats referred to taft's nomination and potential election pre-determined by the powerful roosevelt as a possible forced succession to the presidency
it did not take long for taft's markedly different style and lack of political acumen to emerge joseph b foraker of ohio seeking taft's support in his senatorial re-election made an appearance with taft creating the impression taft was allied with the big business trusts and when taft failed to follow the hearst papers in denouncing foraker's association with them roosevelt became incensed[36] taft also showed his political ineptness by choosing frank hitchcock to be chairman of the republican party hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business which further alienated the progressive wing of the party[37] despite the difference in styles taft had demonstrated for the most part that the substance of his policies echoed those of roosevelt[38] in the end taft won by a comfortable electoral margin giving bryan his worst loss in three presidential campaigns taft defeated bryan by 159 electoral votes however he garnered just 51% of the popular vote[39] mrs taft was quoted quite prophetically saying that there was nothing to criticize except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played[40]
presidency 1909 � 1913 filetaft william h-president (bep engraved portrait)jpg bep engraved portrait of taft as president taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that roosevelt had choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as the previous president had done[41] when a reporter informed him he was no teddy roosevelt taft replied that his main goal was to try to accomplish just as much without any noise[41] taft even made executive decisions (see below) demonstrating his indifference with the press indeed taft's administration marked a change in style from the political charisma of roosevelt to the passion of taft for the rule of law[42] taft in fashioning his cabinet showed also that he was not unwilling to depart to some degree from roosevelt's progressivism he named an anti-progressive philander chase knox secretary of state who had primary influence over other appointments[43]
taft considered himself a progressive in part from his belief in an expansive use of the rule of law as the prevailing device that should be actively used by judges and others in authority to solve society's and even the world's problems but his devotion to the law also often made taft a slave to precedent and less adroit in politics than roosevelt he therefore lacked the flexibility creativity and personal magnetism of his mentor not to mention the publicity devices the dedicated supporters and the broad base of public support that made roosevelt so formidable[44][45]
the divergent views of the two men over the powers of the executive is well articulated in their respective memoirs in summary roosevelt for his part believed 'the president has not just a right but a duty to do anything demanded by the needs of the nation unless such action is forbidden by the constitution or federal law taft's general opinion on the other hand was that the president can exercise no power which cannot fairly be traced to some specific grant of power in the constitution or act of congress[46]
domestic policies and politics official white house portrait of william howard taft painted in 1911 by anders zorn keller argues that taft in his way was a progressive president surpassing tr in antitrust suits and subscribing to an administrative more than political model of the presidency[47] taft however increasingly came to blows with the progressive faction of the gop which looked to roosevelt or lafollette for leadership taft thus increasingly depended on the conservative faction of his party
when president roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would divide the republican party he assumed a low profile on that issue taft ignored the political dynamite and kept the tariff rates on his agenda (he had raised expectations of lower rates in the campaign) he passively encouraged congressional reformers to draft bills including lower rates while broadcasting a willingness to compromise with conservative leaders in the congress who wanted to keep tariff rates high taft described this approach as his policy of harmony with the congress[48] the president displayed a more aggressive role early in the drafting of tariff legislation as it regarded the philippines he also assumed a similar role in pushing for a corporate income tax on other matters he was content to wait until legislation reached its final stage in a joint house�senate conference committee once there however he jumped in with both feet calling each and every member of the committee for a one-on-one meeting at the white house[48] the resulting tariff rates in the payne�aldrich tariff act of 1909 were too high for the progressives based in part on taft's campaign promises but instead of blaming the act's shortcomings on senator nelson w aldrich and big business taft claimed the responsibility calling it the best bill to come from the republican party again due to his results-oriented style politically he had managed to alienate all sides[49] the bureau of trade relations later concluded the act overall was moderately successful in lowering rates[50] congress refused however to fund the tariff board which the president included in the payne�aldrich bill which would have removed the setting of rates from direct continual congressional manipulation[51]
taft was less likely to speak critically of big business than roosevelt nevertheless his rule-of-law orientation resulted in the filing of 90 antitrust suits during his administration compared to 54 such suits by roosevelt's two-term justice department taft's efforts included one suit against the country's largest corporation us steel for the acquisition of a tennessee company during roosevelt's tenure[52] the lawsuit even named roosevelt personally without taft's knowledge this was responsible for a complete break with roosevelt[53] progressives within the republican party began to actively oppose taft senator robert lafollette of wisconsin created the national progressive republican league to replace taft on the national level although his campaign crashed after a disastrous speech most of lafollette's supporters went over to roosevelt the business community and the conservative wing of the party were also alienated from taft and contributions to the gop dried up[54]
taft's administration got a political boost after 25 western railroads announced an intent to raise rates by 20% and taft responded first with a threat to enforce the sherman antitrust act against them he then negotiated a settlement whereby they agreed to submit delayed rate requests to a new interstate commerce commission having authority over rate requests[55]
in late 1911 president taft called for a �central organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country� just four months later on april 22 1912 taft created the united states chamber of commerce as a counterbalance to the rise of the labor movement at the time[56]
taft's obsession with the law over politics created more trouble for him in the well noted dispute between his interior secretary richard achilles ballinger and the chief of the forestry service gifford pinchot ballinger's job was to assure the proper legal form of land withdrawals made from the private sector as part of roosevelt's conservation policy ballinger's review in many instances concluded that the legalities were lacking and lands had to be returned to private owners pinchot led the objections to these returns and even convinced an interior department subordinate louis glavis to bring an accusation against ballinger for fraud and collusion with corporate timber interests taft refused to intervene until the resulting discord in the cabinet forced him to act the president reviewed the matter then fired glavis and pinchot ballinger also tendered his resignation which would have further served to end the matter were it not for taft's refusal to accept it by that time the political damage had been done with further alienation of the progressives from the administration
taft ever reluctant to dismiss cabinet members nevertheless used the resignations of ballinger and war secretary dickinson to modify the complexion of the cabinet by appointing more progressive republicans walter l fisher from the national conservation league and an ally of pinchot replaced ballinger henry l stimson another progressive replaced dickinson[57] taft's overriding concern in making most appointments however was ability and experience not party or faction alignment this was particularly the case with respect to judiciary appointments specifically in the south where taft felt the courts were the weakest[58] taft's high standards which reduced the influence of senatorial courtesy in the selection process resulted in the placement of over one hundred well qualified federal judges[citation needed] nevertheless in the process taft passed up yet another opportunity to embolden himself politically through the use of patronage[59]
in the area of federal spending taft initiated reforms which would revolutionize the executive's role in the federal government's budget process previously each executive department presented to the treasury dept its own expense estimates which were then forwarded to the congress taft ordered each department to begin submitting its requests to the cabinet for review the first such round of requests and cabinet reviews resulted in a reduction of $92 million representing the first actual presidential budget in modern history[60] taft then requested and received approval and funding to create the commission on economy and efficiency to study the budgeting process the study recommended the president be required early in the congressional session to present the legislature with a comprehensive budget this recommendation ultimately became law with passage of the budget and accounting act of 1921[61]
taft's policy of harmony with congress facilitated passage of most of his legislative program nevertheless in the 1910 midterm elections the democrats assumed control of the house for the first time in 16 years at the same time in the senate while the republicans retained their majority they lost 8 seats[62]
corporate income tax to solve an impasse during the 1909 tariff debate taft proposed income taxes for corporations and a constitutional amendment to remove the apportionment requirement for taxes on incomes from property (taxes on dividends interest and rents) on june 16 1909[63] his proposed tax on corporate net income was 1% on net profits over $5000 it was designated an excise on the privilege of doing business as a corporation whose stockholders enjoyed the privilege of limited liability and not a tax on incomes as such in 1911 the supreme court in flint v stone tracy co upheld the tax receipts grew from $21&#160million in the fiscal year 1910 to $348&#160million in 1912
in july 1909 a proposed amendment to allow the federal government to tax incomes was passed unanimously in the senate and by a vote of 318 to 14 in the house it was quickly ratified by the states and on february 3 1913 it became a part of the constitution as the sixteenth amendment
african americans and immigrants taft announced in his inaugural address his intention of refusing to appoint african americans to offices where this would cause race friction termed his southern policy this stance effectively invited white protests wherever blacks were to be or had already been appointed taft made good on his stated intention and removed most black office holders in the south and made only token appointments in the north[64] taft was however the first president to hire african americans security guards in the white house[65]
taft met with booker t washington and publicly endorsed his program for the uplifting of black americans he advised them to stay out of politics at the time and emphasize education and entrepreneurship a supporter of free immigration taft vetoed a law passed by congress and supported by labor unions that would have restricted unskilled laborers by imposing a literacy test[66]
foreign policy see also dollar diplomacy and argentine participation in the south american dreadnought race president william howard taft the president surprised the diplomatic arena with his early dismissal of one of the state department's most experienced diplomats henry white the ambassador to france the only suspected reason for this decision was that white was thought to have somehow slighted the president and his wife 25 years earlier on their honeymoon in europe taft was oblivious to the serious damage that this decision caused his political reputation[67] (the following year white accepted taft's appointment to head a delegation to the pan-american conference in buenos aires)
the president made it a top priority to reorganize the state department saying it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900[68] the department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions including the far east the near east latin america and western europe this reorganization was engineered in large part by secretary of state knox's first assistant secretary huntington wilson who served as de facto secretary of state due to the frequent absence of knox again displaying his inept administrative leadership taft while not sharing any of knox's respect for wilson's ability deferred to much of wilson's policy making[69]
the president personally engaged in talks with the chinese to provide american assistance in the expansion of the chinese railroad industry this was accomplished through participation in the multi-national hukuang loan the effort was dubbed shirt sleeves diplomacy[70] initial success in china led to an extended effort by the president to effect the open door policy particularly in manchuria this was not successful due in large part to the president's reliance on the inexperienced knox who failed to properly assess the objections of japan and russia[71]
taft actively promoted the nation's role in the economic development of latin america specifically through the honduras and nicaragua conventions the concept referred to as dollar diplomacy called for the state department to coordinate loans to the countries for infrastructure improvement from the largest banks in the us strategically this was designed to strengthen security for the panama canal increase american trade and diminish the presence of european nations in the area progressives and insurgent republicans in the senate opposed the wall street connection so the effort was largely a failure[72] the president was more successful in argentina where agreements were reached whereby the us provided loans to enable argentina to acquire battleships some naval construction and design secrets were sacrificed in the arrangement[73]
another of taft's goals was the furtherance of world peace he believed that international arbitration between adversarial nations could be utilized as the best means to avoid armed conflict this was a logical extension of his boundless faith in the rule of law as a progressive and it therefore even superseded us nationalism as embodied in the constitution hence he found no objection to surrendering to an international body jurisdiction over the nation's rights in international affairs as a result he championed arbitration treaties with britain and france[74] the senate was not prepared to make such a surrender of the nation's interests and approved the treaties but only with modifications that provided the senate with a veto over any decisions made in arbitration[75]
in the 1911 congressional session taft's most potentially notable achievement was approval of a reciprocity agreement with canada which proposed to drastically lower trade barriers the passage was accomplished with the cooperation of some democrats and at a considerable cost of republican unity[76] the president confessed to roosevelt i think it may break the republican party for a while taft also responded to criticism from party leaders saying i do not give a tinker's dam whether it injures my political prospects or not[77] despite the potential benefits of the agreement to the country which roosevelt as well understood and anticipated all was for naught when the canadian legislature refused to approve it[78]
assassination attempt in 1909 taft and porfirio d�az planned a summit in el paso texas and ciudad ju�rez mexico an historic first meeting between a us president and a mexican president and also the first time an american president would cross the border into mexico[79] diaz requested the meeting to show us support for his planned eighth run as president and taft agreed to support diaz in order to protect the several billion dollars of american capital then invested in mexico[80] both sides agreed that the disputed chamizal strip connecting el paso to ciudad ju�rez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns[81] the texas rangers 4000 us and mexican troops us secret service agents fbi agents and us marshals were all called in to provide security[82] an additional 250-person private security detail led by frederick russell burnham the celebrated scout was hired by john hays hammond a close friend of taft from yale and a former candidate for us vice-president in 1908 who along with his business partner burnham held considerable mining interests in mexico[83][84][85] on october 16 the day of the summit burnham and private cr moore a texas ranger discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the el paso chamber of commerce building along the procession route[86] burnham and moore captured and disarmed the would be assassin within only a few feet of taft and d�az[87]
no foreign affairs controversy tested taft's statesmanship and commitment to peace more than the subsequent uprising in mexico against the authoritarian regime of the aging d�az which had attracted billions in capital investment for economic development much of it from the us[88] anti-regime (and anti-american) riots began in 1910 and were reported by ambassador henry lane wilson to knox who failed to pass the information on to the president some months later wilson met with taft (knox was out of town on vacation) and upon hearing the information the president immediately and unilaterally ordered a mobilization of 25000 troops to the mexican border as well as naval maneuvers in the gulf of mexico taft publicly directed that no intervention of troops into mexico was to occur without congressional authorization[89] the president's restraint in the name of peace was difficult to maintain in arizona two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured as a result of the uprising but taft would not be goaded into fighting and so instructed the arizona governor[90]
1912 presidential campaign and election see also united states presidential election 1912 taft and roosevelt � political enemies in 1912 the results of the 1910 elections made it clear to the president that roosevelt had departed his camp and that he might even contend for the party nomination in 1912[91] on his return from europe roosevelt openly broke with taft in one of the notable political feuds of the 20th century to the surprise of observers who thought roosevelt had unstoppable momentum taft determined he would not simply step aside for the popular ex-president despite the diminished support he had in the party taft acknowledged this saying the longer i am president the less of a party man i seem to become[92] roosevelt declared his candidacy for the republican nomination in february 1912 taft soon decided that he would focus on canvassing for delegates and not attempt at the outset to take on the more able campaigner one on one[93] as roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re-nomination as he was convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government[94] taft ultimately outmaneuvered roosevelt and senator robert m la follette sr in delegate count regained control of the gop convention and defeated roosevelt for the nomination[95]
roosevelt and his group of disgruntled party delegates and members bolted from the party to create the progressive party (or bull moose) ticket splitting the republican vote in the 1912 election[95] taft thought that despite probable defeat the party had been preserved as the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions he also felt that the expected defeat would remind the party of the need for self-discipline in the face of populist rancor[96] woodrow wilson the democrat was elected with 41% of the popular vote roosevelt got 27% and taft garnered 23% taft won a mere eight electoral votes in utah and vermont making it the worst defeat in american history of an incumbent president seeking reelection[97]
the defeated president had long ago acknowledged his weakness as a campaigner and as well his failure to do the necessary political housekeeping when decisions were made he also refused to recognize the need to publicize his policies and decisions saying after i have made a definite statement i have to let it go at that until the time for action arises[98] taft's indifference towards the press even extended to legislation where he failed to recognize the press' need for reduced tariffs on print paper and wood pulp[99] he further alienated the press when recommending that a deficit in the post office be reduced by eliminating the lower second class rates afforded to magazines and newspapers[100] taft commented as follows on the state of his party after the election it behooves the republicans to gather again to the party standard and pledge anew their faith in their party's principles and to organize again to defend the constitutional government handed down to us by our fathers without compromising our principles we must convince and win back former republicans and we must reinforce our ranks with constitution-loving democrats [101]
in spite of his failure to be re-elected taft achieved what he felt were his main goals as president keeping permanent control of the party and keeping the courts sacrosanct until they were next threatened while the strife during the election of 1912 devastated the once very close friendship between taft and theodore roosevelt the two eventually did reconcile not long before roosevelt's death in 1919[102]

(photographed by harris & ewing photo studio) judicial appointments taft picked edward douglass white to be chief justice of the united states main article william howard taft judicial appointments supreme court taft appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states
horace harmon lurton&#160� 1909 charles evans hughes&#160� 1910 edward douglass white&#160� chief justice&#160� 1910 willis van devanter&#160� 1911 joseph rucker lamar&#160� 1911 mahlon pitney&#160� 1912 taft's six appointments to the court rank below only those of george washington (who appointed all six justices to the first court) and of franklin d roosevelt (who was president for just over twelve years) and equals that of andrew jackson taft's appointment of five new justices tied the number appointed by both dwight d eisenhower and abraham lincoln four of taft's appointees were relatively young aged 48 51 53 and 54
the appointments of edward douglass white and charles evans hughes also are notable because taft essentially appointed both his predecessor and successor chief justices respectively already on the court as an associate justice since 1894 white was the first chief justice to be elevated from an associate justiceship since president george washington appointed john rutledge to chief justice in 1795 hughes initially was appointed an associate justice but later resigned to run as the republican party's presidential candidate in the 1916 election which he would lose president herbert hoover renominated hughes to the supreme court as chief justice following taft's retirement
other judicial appointments besides his supreme court appointments taft appointed 13 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 38 judges to the united states district courts taft also appointed judges to various specialty courts including the first five appointees each to the united states commerce court and the united states court of customs appeals the commerce court was abolished in 1913 taft was thus the only president to appoint judges to that body
states admitted to the union new mexico january 6 1912 arizona february 14 1912 taft insisted that the recall provision for judges be removed from the state constitution before he would approve it after it was removed taft signed the statehood bill and state residents promptly put the provision back in[103][104] post-presidency upon leaving the white house in 1913 taft was appointed the chancellor kent professor of law and legal history at yale law school[7] while at yale taft was initiated as an honorary member of the acacia fraternity at the same time taft was elected president of the american bar association he spent much of his time writing newspaper articles and books most notably his series on american legal philosophy he was a vigorous opponent of prohibition in the united states predicting the undesirable situation that the eighteenth amendment would create[105] he also continued to advocate world peace through international arbitration urging nations to enter into arbitration treaties with each other and promoting the idea of a league of nations even before the first world war began taft was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1914[106] additionally he lectured on legal ethics at boston university from 1918 to 1921[107]
when world war i did break out in europe in 1914 however taft founded the league to enforce peace he was a co-chairman of the powerful national war labor board between 1917 and 1918
taft also supported the war effort by joining the connecticut home guard an organization formed to perform many of the in-state duties of the national guard while the national guard was deployed overseas[108][109]
although he continually advocated peace he strongly favored conscription once the united states entered the war pleading publicly that the united states not fight a finicky war he feared the war would be long but was for fighting it out to a finish given what he viewed as germany's brutality
chief justice 1921�1930 chief justice taft ca 1921 nomination check signed by taft on this first day as chief justice of the united states on june 30 1921 following the death of chief justice edward douglass white (whom taft himself had nominated) president warren g harding nominated taft to take his place for a man who had once remarked there is nothing i would have loved more than being chief justice of the united states the nomination to oversee the highest court in the land was like a dream come true[110] there was little opposition to the nomination and the senate approved him 60-4 in a secret session on the day of his nomination but the roll call of the vote has never been made public[111] taft received his commission immediately and readily took up the position taking the oath of office on july 11 and serving until 1930 as such he became the only president to serve as chief justice and thus the only former president to swear in subsequent presidents giving the oath of office to both calvin coolidge (in 1925) and herbert hoover (in 1929)
taft enjoyed his years on the court and was respected by his peers justice felix frankfurter once remarked to justice louis brandeis that it was difficult for me to understand why a man who is so good a chief justicecould have been so bad as president[110] taft remains the only person to have led both the executive and judicial branches of the united states government he considered his time as chief justice to be the highest point of his career allegedly he once remarked i do not remember that i was ever president[112]
chief justice taft with president warren g harding and former secretary of war robert todd lincoln may 1922 accomplishments in 1922 taft traveled to england to study the procedural structure of the english courts and to learn how they dropped such a large number of cases quickly during the trip king george v and queen mary received taft and his wife as state visitors
with what he had learned in england taft decided to advocate the introduction and passage of the judiciary act of 1925 which shifts the supreme court's appellate jurisdiction to be largely discretionary upon review of litigants' petitioning to be granted an appeal (see also writ of certiorari) this allowed the supreme court to give preference to what they believed to be cases of national importance and allowed the court to work more efficiently
besides giving the supreme court more control over its docket supporting new legislation and organizing the judicial conference taft gave the supreme court and the chief justice general supervisory power over the scattered and disorganized federal courts
the legislation also brought the courts of the district of columbia and of the territories (and soon the commonwealths of the philippines and puerto rico) into the federal court system this united the courts for the first time as an independent third branch of government under the administrative supervision of the chief justice taft was also the first justice to employ two full-time law clerks to assist him
in 1929 taft successfully argued in favor of the construction of a separate and spacious supreme court building reasoning that the supreme court needed to distance itself from the congress as a separate branch of the federal government until then the court had heard cases in the old senate chamber of the capitol the justices had no private chambers there and their conferences were held in a room in the capitol's basement the building was completed in 1935 five years after taft's death and remains the seat of the supreme court to this day
opinions see also list of united states supreme court cases by the taft court while chief justice taft wrote the opinion for the court in 256 cases out of the court's ever-growing caseload his philosophy of constitutional interpretation was essentially historical contextualism some of his more notable opinions include
the us supreme court in 1925 taft is seated in the bottom row middle balzac v porto rico 258 us 298 (1922) (opinion for the court) ruling that the fourteenth amendment did not apply the criminal provisions of the bill of rights to overseas territories this was one of the more famous of the insular cases bailey v drexel furniture co 259 us 20 (1922) (opinion for the court) holding the 1919 child labor tax law unconstitutional hill v wallace 259 us 44 (1922) (opinion for the court) holding the future trading act an unconstitutional use of congress's taxing power adkins v children's hospital 261 us 525 (1923) (dissenting opinion) disapproving of the court's upholding of lochner v new york in 1937 the supreme court agreed with taft and reversed this decision permanently board of trade of city of chicago v olsen 262 us 1 (1923) (opinion for the court) upholding the constitutionality of the grain futures act under the commerce clause ex parte grossman 267 us 87 (1925) (opinion for the court) holding that the president's pardon power extends to pardoning people held for criminal contempt while the supreme court rules provide for issuing writs of habeas corpus within the court's original jurisdiction taft's opinion in grossman was the last time the court did so[113] carroll v united states 267 us 132 (1925) (opinion for the court) holding that police searches of automobiles without a warrant do not violate the fourth amendment when the police have probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in the automobile samuels v mccurdy 267 us 188 (1925) (opinion for the court) holding that a prohibition on an item formerly possessed legally is not an ex post facto law because its possession is an ongoing condition myers v united states 272 us 52 (1926) (opinion for the court) ruling that the president of the united states had the power to unilaterally dismiss executive branch appointees who had been confirmed by the senate united states v general electric co 272 us 476 (1926) (opinion for the court) ruling that a patentee who has granted a single license to a competitor to manufacture the patented product may lawfully fix the price at which the licensee may sell the product lum v rice 275 us 78 (1927) (opinion for the court) ruling that the fourteenth amendment did not prohibit mississippi's prevention of asian children attending white schools during racial segregation the supreme court reversed this opinion in 1954 olmstead v united states 277 us 438 (1928) (opinion for the court) ruling that the judicial practice of excluding evidence obtained without a warrant was based on the fourth amendment's proscription on unreasonable search and seizure but did not apply to telephone wiretapping wisconsin v illinois 278 us 367 (1929) (opinion for the court) holding that the equitable power of the united states can be used to impose positive action on the states in a situation where non-action would result in damage to the interests of other states old colony trust co v commissioner 279 us 716 (1929) (opinion for the court) holding that where a third party pays the income tax owed by an individual the amount of tax paid constitutes additional income to the taxpayer medical conditions and weight taft is often remembered as being the most obese president[114] he was 5&#160feet 11&#160inches (180&#160m) tall his weight peaked at 335�340 pounds (150&#160kg) toward the end of his presidency[115] the truth of the story of taft getting stuck in a white house bathtub is unclear however he once did overflow a bathtub[116][117]
evidence from eyewitnesses and from taft himself strongly suggests that during his presidency he had severe obstructive sleep apnea[115] his chief symptom was somnolence while president he fell asleep during conversations and at the dinner table and even while standing he was also strikingly hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure over 200[118]
within a year of leaving the presidency taft lost approximately 80 pounds (36&#160kg) his somnolence problem resolved and less obviously his systolic blood pressure dropped 40�50 mmhg (from 210 mmhg) undoubtedly this weight loss extended his life[119]
soon after his weight loss he had a revival of interest in the outdoors this led him to explore alaska[120] beginning in 1920 taft used a cane this was a gift from professor of geology w s foster and was made of 250000-year-old petrified wood[121]
after several heart attacks in 1924 taft was slowing down he wrote in 1925 that his memory was becoming poorer and in 1928 my mind does not work as well as it did and i scatter[122] when he administered the oath of office to president hoover on march 4 1929 he recited part of the oath incorrectly later writing in a personal letter  my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain misquoting again in that letter but differently[123]
death and legacy taft's headstone at arlington national cemetery taft began experiencing hallucinations as 1930 began on february 3 he stepped down from the supreme court charles evans hughes whom he had appointed as an associate justice while president succeeded him as chief justice an official statement by his doctors announced that he had suffered from heart disease and atherosclerosis for years but that he had no other serious ailments
five weeks following his retirement some of which was spent in a state of semi-consciousness taft died on march 8 1930 from cardiovascular disease and the same date as associate justice edward terry sanford's unexpected death as it was customary for members of the court to attend the funeral of deceased members this posed a logistical nightmare necessitating traveling immediately from knoxville tennessee for sanford's funeral to washington for taft's funeral[124][125] the house at which taft died is now the diplomatic mission of the syrian arab republic to the united states[126]
three days following his death on march 11 he became the first president and first chief justice to be buried at arlington national cemetery[124][127] james earle fraser sculpted his grave marker out of stony creek granite[127] taft is one of two presidents buried at arlington national cemetery (the other is john f kennedy) and is one of four chief justices buried there (earl warren warren e burger and william rehnquist are the others) as a former president taft was the only chief justice to have had a state funeral
in 1938 a third generation of the taft family entered the national political stage with the election of the former president's oldest son robert a taft i to the senate where he became a leader of the conservative republicans president taft's other son charles phelps taft ii served as the mayor of cincinnati from 1955 to 1957
president taft's enduring legacy includes many things named after him the william howard taft national historic site is the taft boyhood home the house in which he was born has been restored to its original appearance it includes four period rooms reflecting family life during taft's boyhood and second-floor exhibits highlighting taft's life[128] others include the courthouse of the ohio court of appeals for the first district in cincinnati streets in cincinnati arlington virginia and taft avenue in manila philippines the taft bridge in washington dc a law school in santa ana california[129] and high schools in san antonio texas woodland hills california chicago illinois and the bronx taft eastern samar a town in the philippines was named after him after a fire burned much of the town of moron california in the 1920s it was renamed taft california in his honor
george burroughs torrey painted a portrait of him taft is the last president to have sported facial hair while in office[130]
