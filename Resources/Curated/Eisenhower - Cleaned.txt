eisenhower was of pennsylvania dutch ancestry and was raised in a large family in kansas by parents with a strong religious background he graduated from west point and later married and had two sons after world war ii eisenhower served as army chief of staff under president harry s truman and then accepted the post of president at columbia university[3]
eisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a republican to counter the non-interventionism of senator robert a taft campaigning against communism korea and corruption he won in a landslide defeating democratic candidate adlai stevenson and temporarily upending the new deal coalition
eisenhower's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the soviet union and reduce federal deficits in the first year of his presidency he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in order to conclude the korean war his new look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces in 1954 eisenhower rejected the use of military force to help the french retain their colony of vietnam congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the formosa resolution which obliged the us to militarily support the pro-western republic of china in taiwan and continue the ostracism of the people's republic of china
after the soviet union launched the world's first artificial satellite in 1957 eisenhower authorized the establishment of nasa which led to the space race during the suez crisis of 1956 eisenhower condemned the israeli british and french invasion of egypt and forced them to withdraw he also condemned the soviet invasion during the hungarian revolution of 1956 but took no action in 1958 eisenhower sent 15000 us troops to lebanon to prevent the pro-western government from falling to a nasser-inspired revolution near the end of his term his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the soviets collapsed because of the u-2 incident[4] in his january 17 1961 farewell address to the nation eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of corporate control of congress and massive military spending particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers and coined the term military-industrial complex[5]
on the domestic front he covertly opposed joseph mccarthy and contributed to the end of mccarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege he otherwise left most political activity to his vice president richard nixon he was a moderate conservative who continued new deal agencies and expanded social security he also launched the interstate highway system the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) the establishment of strong science education via the national defense education act and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the atomic energy act[6]
as a part of his domestic policy he sent federal troops to little rock arkansas for the first time since reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools he also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote he implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the supreme court he was the first term-limited president in accordance with the 22nd amendment eisenhower's two terms saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958�59 voted gallup's most admired man twelve times he achieved widespread popular esteem both in and out of office[7] since the late 20th century consensus among western scholars has consistently held eisenhower as one of the greatest us presidents

early life and education[edit] the eisenhower family home abilene kansas the eisenhauer (german for iron hewer/miner) family migrated from karlsbrunn germany to north america first settling in york pennsylvania in 1741 and in the 1880s moving to kansas[8] accounts vary as to how and when the german name eisenhauer was anglicized to eisenhower[9] eisenhower's pennsylvania dutch ancestors who were primarily farmers included hans nikolaus eisenhauer of karlsbrunn who migrated to lancaster pennsylvania in 1741[10]
hans's great-great-grandson david jacob eisenhower (1863�1942) was dwight's father and was a college-educated engineer despite his own father jacob's urging to stay on the family farm eisenhower's mother ida elizabeth (stover) eisenhower born in virginia of german protestant ancestry moved to kansas from virginia she married david on september 23 1885 in lecompton kansas on the campus of their alma mater lane university[11]
david owned a general store in hope kansas but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished the eisenhowers then lived in texas from 1889 until 1892 and later returned to kansas with $24 to their name at the time david worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery[11] by 1898 the parents made a decent living and provided a suitable home for their large family[12]
eisenhower was born on october 14 1890 in denison texas the third of seven boys[13] his mother originally named him david dwight but reversed the two names after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two davids in the family[14] all of the boys were called ike such as big ike (edgar) and little ike (dwight) the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name[15] by world war ii only dwight was still called ike[8]
in 1892 the family moved to abilene kansas which eisenhower considered his home town[8] as a child he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him dwight developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring outdoors hunting/fishing cooking and card playing from an illiterate named bob davis who camped on the smoky hill river[16][17][18]
while eisenhower's mother was against war it was her collection of history books that first sparked eisenhower's early and lasting interest in military history he persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader in the subject other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling[19]
his parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family bible reading chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline usually from david[20] his mother previously a member (with david) of the river brethren sect of the mennonites joined the international bible students association later known as jehovah's witnesses the eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 though eisenhower never joined the international bible students[21] his later decision to attend west point saddened his mother who felt that warfare was rather wicked but she did not overrule him[22] while speaking of himself in 1948 eisenhower said he was one of the most deeply religious men i know though unattached to any sect or organization he was baptized in the presbyterian church in 1953[23]
eisenhower attended abilene high school and graduated with the class of 1909[24] as a freshman he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening the doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but dwight refused to allow it and miraculously recovered though he had to repeat his freshman year[25] he and brother edgar both wanted to attend college though they lacked the funds they made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions[26]
edgar took the first turn at school and dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the belle springs creamery[27] edgar asked for a second year dwight consented and worked for a second year at that time a friend swede hazlet was applying to the naval academy and urged dwight to apply to the school since no tuition was required eisenhower requested consideration for either annapolis or west point with his us senator joseph l bristow though eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition he was beyond the age limit for the naval academy[28] he then accepted an appointment to west point in 1911[28]
eisenhower (2nd from left) and omar bradley (2nd from right) were members of the 1912 west point football team at west point eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports but was less enthusiastic about the hazing though he willingly accepted it as a plebe he was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating academically eisenhower's best subject by far was english otherwise his performance was average though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics[29]
in athletics eisenhower later said that not making the baseball team at west point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life maybe my greatest[30] he did make the football team and was a varsity starter as running back and linebacker in 1912 tackling the legendary jim thorpe of the carlisle indians that year[31] eisenhower suffered a torn knee in that his last game he re-injured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring[8][16][32] so he turned to fencing and gymnastics[8]
eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader at west point he played football[33][34] he graduated in the middle of the class of 1915[35] which became known as the class the stars fell on because 59 members eventually became general officers
personal life[edit] mamie eisenhower eisenhower met and fell in love with mamie geneva doud of boone iowa six years his junior while he was stationed in texas[8] he and her family were also immediately taken with one another he proposed to her on valentine's day in 1916[36] a november wedding date in denver was moved up to july 1 due to the pending us entry into world war i in their first 35 years of marriage they moved many times[37]
the eisenhowers had two sons doud dwight icky eisenhower was born september 24 1917 and died of scarlet fever on january 2 1921 at the age of three[38] eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death[39] their second son john sheldon doud eisenhower was born on august 3 1922 while they were in panama john served in the united states army retired as a brigadier general became an author and served as us ambassador to belgium from 1969 to 1971 john coincidentally graduated from west point on d-day june 6 1944 he married barbara jean thompson on june 10 1947 john and barbara had four children dwight david ii barbara ann susan elaine and mary jean david after whom camp david is named[40] married richard nixon's daughter julie in 1968 john died on december 21 2013[41]
eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life and joined the augusta national golf club in 1948[42] he played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game to the point of golfing during winter and ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground he had a small basic golf facility installed at camp david and became close friends with the augusta national chairman clifford roberts inviting roberts to stay at the white house on several occasions roberts an investment broker also handled the eisenhower family's investments roberts also advised eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs which proved financially lucrative[42]
after golf oil painting was eisenhower's second hobby[39] while at columbia university eisenhower began the art after watching thomas e stephens paint mamie's portrait eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as mamie their grandchildren general montgomery george washington and abraham lincoln[43] wendy beckett stated that eisenhower's work simple and earnest rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president a conservative in both art and politics he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down tin lizzie loaded with paint has been driven over it[39]
angels in the outfield was eisenhower's favorite movie[44] his favorite reading material for relaxation were the western novels of zane grey[45] with his excellent memory and ability to focus eisenhower was skilled at card games he learned poker which he called his favorite indoor sport in abilene eisenhower recorded west point classmates' poker losses for payment after graduation and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him a classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at west point eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months[46]
early military career[edit] see also military career of dwight d eisenhower world war i[edit] after graduation in 1915 lieutenant (2nd) eisenhower put in for assignment in the philippines which was denied he served with the infantry initially in logistics until 1918 at various camps in texas and georgia in 1916 while stationed at fort sam houston eisenhower was football coach for st louis college now st mary's university[47] in late 1917 while in charge of training at ft oglethorpe in georgia mamie had their first son
when the us entered world war i he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to ft leavenworth kansas[48] in february 1918 he was transferred to camp meade in maryland with the 65th engineers his unit was later ordered to france but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the national army[49] he commanded a unit that trained tank crews at camp colt&#160� his first command&#160� at the site of pickett's charge on the gettysburg pennsylvania civil war battleground though eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel[50]
once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to france this time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed just a week before departure[51] completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time despite being given the distinguished service medal for his work at home[citation needed] in world war ii rivals who had combat service in the first great war (led by gen bernard montgomery) sought to denigrate eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty despite his stateside experience establishing a camp completely equipped for thousands of troops and developing a full combat training schedule[52]
in service of generals[edit] eisenhower (far right) with three unidentified people in 1919 four years after graduating from west point after the war eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major a rank he held for 16 years[10] the major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation indeed the convoy averaged only 5&#160mph from washington dc to san francisco later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for eisenhower as president[53]
he assumed duties again at camp meade maryland commanding a battalion of tanks where he remained until 1922 his schooling continued focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s patton sereno e brett and other senior tank leaders their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment and he relented[54][55]
from 1920 eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals&#160� fox conner john j pershing douglas macarthur and george marshall he first became executive officer to general conner in the panama canal zone where joined by mamie he served until 1924 under conner's tutelage he studied military history and theory (including carl von clausewitz's on war) and later cited conner's enormous influence on his military thinking saying in 1962 that fox conner was the ablest man i ever knew conner's comment on eisenhower was [he] is one of the most capable efficient and loyal officers i have ever met[56] on conner's recommendation in 1925�26 he attended the command and general staff college at fort leavenworth kansas where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers[57][58] he then served as a battalion commander at fort benning georgia until 1927
during the late 1920s and early 1930s eisenhower's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat as military priorities diminished many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs he was assigned to the american battle monuments commission directed by general pershing and with the help of his brother milton eisenhower then a journalist at the agriculture department he produced a guide to american battlefields in europe he then was assigned to the army war college and graduated in 1928 after a one-year assignment in france eisenhower served as executive officer to general george v mosely assistant secretary of war from 1929 to february 1933[59]
his primary duty was planning for the next war which proved most difficult in the midst of the great depression[60] he then was posted as chief military aide to general macarthur army chief of staff in 1932 he participated in the clearing of the bonus march encampment in washington dc although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised macarthur against taking a public role in it he later wrote the army's official incident report endorsing macarthur's conduct[61][62]
in 1935 he accompanied macarthur to the philippines where he served as assistant military adviser to the philippine government in developing their army eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of the philippine army and the leadership qualities that an american army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates the dispute and resulting antipathy between eisenhower and macarthur lasted the rest of their lives[63]
historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of winston churchill george s patton george marshall and general montgomery during world war ii eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with macarthur and that a positive relationship endured[64] while in manila mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 he also learned to fly making a solo flight over the philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot's license in 1939 at fort lewis[65] also around this time he was offered a post by the philippine commonwealth government namely by then philippine president manuel l quezon on recommendations by macarthur to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned now named quezon city but he declined the offer[citation needed]
eisenhower returned to the us in december 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th infantry at fort lewis washington in march 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated ix corps under major general kenyon joyce in june 1941 he was appointed chief of staff to general walter krueger commander of the 3rd army at fort sam houston in san antonio texas after successfully participating in the louisiana maneuvers he was promoted to brigadier general on october 3 1941[66][67] although his administrative abilities had been noticed on the eve of the us entry into world war ii he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations
world war ii[edit] after the japanese attack on pearl harbor eisenhower was assigned to the general staff in washington where he served until june 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat japan and germany he was appointed deputy chief in charge of pacific defenses under the chief of war plans division (wpd) general leonard t gerow and then succeeded gerow as chief of the war plans division next he was appointed assistant chief of staff in charge of the new operations division (which replaced wpd) under chief of staff general george c marshall who spotted talent and promoted accordingly[68]
at the end of may 1942 eisenhower accompanied lt gen henry h arnold commanding general of the army air forces to london to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in england maj gen james e chaney he returned to washington on june 3 with a pessimistic assessment stating he had an uneasy feeling about chaney and his staff on june 23 1942 he returned to london as commanding general european theater of operations (etousa) based in london and with a house on coombe kingston upon thames[69] and replaced chaney[70] he was promoted to lieutenant general on july 7
operations torch and avalanche[edit] major general eisenhower 1942 general of the army eisenhower circa 1945 in november 1942 he was also appointed supreme commander allied expeditionary force of the north african theater of operations (natousa) through the new operational headquarters a(e)fhq the word expeditionary was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons[citation needed] the campaign in north africa was designated operation torch and was planned underground within the rock of gibraltar eisenhower was the first non-british person to command gibraltar in 200 years[71]
french cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign and eisenhower encountered a preposterous situation with the multiple rival factions in france his primary objective was to move forces successfully onto tunisia and intending to facilitate that objective he gave his support to fran�ois darlan as high commissioner in north africa despite darlan's previous high offices of state in vichy france and his continued role as commander in chief of french armed forces the allied leaders were thunderstruck by this from a political standpoint though none of them had offered eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation eisenhower was severely criticized for the move darlan was assassinated on december 24 by fernand bonnier de la chapelle eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of bonnier de la chapelle by associates of darlan acting without authority from either vichy or the allies considering it a criminal rather than a military matter[72] eisenhower later appointed general henri giraud as high commissioner who had been installed by the allies as darlan's commander in chief and who had refused to postpone the execution[73]
operation torch also served as a valuable training ground for eisenhower's combat command skills during the initial phase of erwin rommel's move into the kasserine pass eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates he also was initially indecisive in his removal of lloyd fredendall he became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns[74] in february 1943 his authority was extended as commander of afhq across the mediterranean basin to include the british eighth army commanded by general bernard law montgomery the eighth army had advanced across the western desert from the east and was ready for the start of the tunisia campaign eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of etousa to become commander of natousa
after the capitulation of axis forces in north africa eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of sicily once mussolini had fallen in italy the allies switched their attention to the mainland with operation avalanche but while eisenhower argued with roosevelt and churchill who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the italians the germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country&#160� making the job more difficult by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the allied forces 2 to 1 nevertheless the invasion of italy was highly successful[75]
supreme allied commander and operation overlord[edit] eisenhower with us paratroopers of the 502nd parachute infantry regiment 101st airborne division on june 5 1944 the day before the d-day invasion in december 1943 president roosevelt decided that eisenhower&#160� not marshall&#160� would be supreme allied commander in europe the following month he resumed command of etousa and the following month was officially designated as the supreme allied commander of the allied expeditionary force (shaef) serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in europe in may 1945[76] he was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the allied assault on the coast of normandy in june 1944 under the code name operation overlord the liberation of western europe and the invasion of germany
from left front row includes army officers simpson patton spaatz eisenhower bradley hodges and gerow in 1945 eisenhower as well as the officers and troops under him had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations and their skill sets had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the germans�a beach landing assault his first struggles however were with allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the normandy invasion he argued with roosevelt over an essential agreement with de gaulle to use french resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the germans in advance of overlord[77] admiral ernest j king fought with eisenhower over king's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the pacific[78] he also insisted that the british give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate overlord to the point of threatening to resign unless churchill relented as he did[79] eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in france in advance of overlord and argued with churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties de gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the germans and eisenhower prevailed[80] he also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly george s patton by severely reprimanding him when patton earlier had slapped a subordinate and then when patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy[81]
the d-day normandy landings on june 6 1944 were costly but successful a month later the invasion of southern france took place and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the afhq to the shaef many prematurely considered that victory in europe would come by summer's end�however the germans did not capitulate for almost a year from then until the end of the war in europe on may 8 1945 eisenhower through shaef commanded all allied forces and through his command of etousa had administrative command of all us forces on the western front north of the alps he was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families this prompted him to make a point of personally visiting every division involved in the invasion[82] eisenhower's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed it has been called one of the great speeches of history
our landings in the cherbourg-havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and i have withdrawn the troops my decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone[83]
liberation of france and victory in europe[edit] eisenhower with some allied commanders following the signing of the german instrument of surrender at reims once the coastal assault had succeeded eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through france on germany field marshal montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st army group's attack being made in the north while generals bradley (12th us army group) and devers (sixth us army group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively) eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize allied forces often by giving them tactical though sometimes ineffective latitude many historians conclude this delayed the allied victory in europe however due to eisenhower's persistence the pivotal supply port at antwerp was successfully albeit belatedly opened in late 1944 and victory became a more distinct probability[84]
in recognition of his senior position in the allied command on december 20 1944 he was promoted to general of the army equivalent to the rank of field marshal in most european armies in this and the previous high commands he held eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy although he had never seen action himself he won the respect of front-line commanders he interacted adeptly with allies such as winston churchill field marshal bernard montgomery and general charles de gaulle he had serious disagreements with churchill and montgomery over questions of strategy but these rarely upset his relationships with them he dealt with soviet marshal zhukov his russian counterpart and they became good friends[85]
the germans launched a surprise counter offensive in the battle of the bulge in december 1944 which the allies turned back in early 1945 after eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the air force to engage[86] german defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the soviets and the western front with the allies the british wanted berlin but eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack berlin and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit the british backed down but then wanted eisenhower to move into czechoslovakia for political reasons washington refused to support churchill's plan to use eisenhower's army for political maneuvers against moscow the actual division of germany followed the lines that roosevelt churchill and stalin had previously agreed upon the soviet red army captured berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle and the germans finally surrendered on may 7 1945[87]
post world war ii[edit] military governor in germany and army chief of staff[edit] the sphere of influence for general eisenhower in allied-occupied germany following the german unconditional surrender eisenhower was appointed military governor of the us occupation zone based at the ig farben building in frankfurt am main he had no responsibility for the other three zones controlled by britain france and the soviet union except for the city of berlin which was managed by the four-power authorities through the allied kommandatura as the governing body upon discovery of the nazi concentration camps he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the nuremberg trials he reclassified german prisoners of war (pows) in us custody as disarmed enemy forces (defs) who were no longer subject to the geneva convention eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the joint chiefs of staff (jcs) in directive jcs 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization[88][89][90] in response to the devastation in germany including food shortages and an influx of refugees he arranged distribution of american food and medical equipment[91] his actions reflected the new american attitudes of the german people as nazi victims not villains while aggressively purging the ex-nazis[92][93]
in november 1945 eisenhower returned to washington to replace marshall as chief of staff of the army his main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the soviet union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained he strongly supported the new united nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs however in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the soviets truman was guided by the us state department and ignored eisenhower and the pentagon indeed eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the japanese writing first the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing second i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon[94] by mid-1947 as east�west tensions over economic recovery in germany and the greek civil war escalated eisenhower gave up his hopes for cooperation with the soviets and agreed with a containment policy to stop soviet expansion[95]
1948 presidential election[edit] in june 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to eisenhower that he might become president of the united states after the war believing that a general should not participate in politics one author later wrote that figuratively speaking [eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office as others asked him about his political future eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job from dogcatcher to grand high supreme king of the universe and another that he could not serve as army chief of staff if others believed he had political ambitions in 1945 truman told eisenhower during the potsdam conference that if desired the president would help the general win the 1948 election[96] and in 1947 he offered to run as eisenhower's running mate on the democratic ticket if macarthur won the republican nomination[97]
as the election approached other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged eisenhower to run for president in january 1948 after learning of plans in new hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming republican national convention eisenhower stated through the army that he was not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office life-long professional soldiers he wrote in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason [should] abstain from seeking high political office[96] eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president republican thomas e dewey was considered the other probable winner would presumably serve two terms and eisenhower at age 66 in 1956 would then be too old[98]
president at columbia university and nato supreme commander[edit] the supreme commanders of the four powers on june 5 1945 in berlin bernard montgomery dwight d eisenhower georgy zhukov and jean de lattre de tassigny in 1948 eisenhower became president of columbia university an ivy league university in new york the assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction[99] during that year eisenhower's memoir crusade in europe was published[100] critics regarded it as one of the finest us military memoirs and it was a major financial success as well eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the us department of the treasury that eisenhower was not a professional writer but rather marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $635000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate this ruling saved eisenhower about $400000[101]
eisenhower's stint as the president of columbia university was punctuated by his activity within the council on foreign relations a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the marshall plan and the american assembly eisenhower's vision of a great cultural center where business professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature his biographer blanche wiesen cook suggested that this period served as the political education of general eisenhower since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational administrative and financial demands for the university through his involvement in the council on foreign relations he also gained exposure to economic analysis which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy whatever general eisenhower knows about economics he has learned at the study group meetings one aid to europe member claimed
eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote the american form of democracy through education he was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee he informed them that his main purpose was to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy as a result he was almost incessantly devoted to the idea of the american assembly a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950
within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university eisenhower was requested to advise us secretary of defense james forrestal on the unification of the armed services about six months after his appointment he became the informal chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in washington two months later he fell ill and he spent over a month in recovery at the augusta national golf club he returned to his post in new york in mid-may and in july 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state because the american assembly had begun to take shape he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 building financial support from columbia associates an alumni association
eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the columbia university faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests as a career military man he naturally had little in common with the academics[102]
the contacts gained through university and american assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in eisenhower's bid for the republican party nomination and the presidency meanwhile columbia university's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president's ties to oilmen and businessmen including leonard mccollum the president of continental oil frank abrams the chairman of standard oil of new jersey bob kleberg the president of the king ranch h j porter a texas oil executive bob woodruff the president of the coca-cola corporation and clarence francis the chairman of general foods
as the president of columbia eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of american democracy his tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership his biographer travis beal jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years[103]
the trustees of columbia university refused to accept eisenhower's resignation in december 1950 when he took an extended leave from the university to become the supreme commander of the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and he was given operational command of nato forces in europe eisenhower retired from active service as an army general on may 31 1952 and he resumed his presidency of columbia he held this position until january 20 1953 when he became the president of the united states
nato did not have strong bipartisan support in congress at the time that eisenhower assumed its military command eisenhower advised the participating european nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the nato force before such would come from the war-weary united states
at home eisenhower was more effective in making the case for nato in congress than the truman administration was by the middle of 1951 american and european support for nato was substantial enough to give it a genuine military power nevertheless eisenhower thought that nato would become a truly european alliance with the american and canadian commitments ending after about ten years[104]
presidential campaign of 1952[edit] main article united states presidential election 1952 i like ike button from the 1952 campaign president truman symbolizing a broad-based desire for an eisenhower candidacy for president again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a democrat it was at this time that eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the democratic party and declared himself and his family to be republicans[105] a draft eisenhower movement in the republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist senator robert a taft the effort was a long struggle eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their president henry cabot lodge who served as his campaign manager and others succeeded in convincing him and in june 1952 he resigned his command at nato to campaign full-time[106] eisenhower defeated taft for the nomination having won critical delegate votes from texas eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan i like ike it was essential to his success that eisenhower express opposition to roosevelt's policy at yalta and against truman's policies in korea and china�matters in which he had once participated[107][108] in defeating taft for the nomination it became necessary for eisenhower to appease the right wing old guard of the republican party his selection of richard m nixon as the vice-president on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter ike's more advanced age[109]
1952 electoral vote results in the general election against the advice of his advisors eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the south refusing to surrender the region to the democratic party the campaign strategy dubbed k1c2 was to focus on attacking the truman and roosevelt administrations on three issues korea communism and corruption in an effort to accommodate the right he stressed that the liberation of eastern europe should be by peaceful means only he also distanced himself from his former boss president truman
two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff but did not affect the campaign one involved a report that nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates the second issue centered on eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of joseph mccarthy on his home turf in a wisconsin appearance[110] just two weeks prior to the election eisenhower vowed to go to korea and end the war there he promised to maintain a strong commitment against communism while avoiding the topic of nato finally he stressed a corruption-free frugal administration at home
he defeated democratic candidate adlai stevenson in a landslide with an electoral margin of 442 to 89 marking the first republican return to the white house in 20 years[108] in the election he also brought with him a republican majority in the house (by eight votes) and in the senate (actually a tie with nixon providing the majority vote)[111]
eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century and at age 62 was the oldest man elected president since james buchanan in 1856 (president truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier)[112] eisenhower was the only general to serve as president in the 20th century and the most recent president to have never held elected office prior to the presidency (the other presidents who did not have prior elected office were zachary taylor ulysses s grant william howard taft and herbert hoover)
presidency (1953�1961)[edit] main article presidency of dwight d eisenhower due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning truman and eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations[113] after selecting his budget director joseph m dodge eisenhower asked herbert brownell and lucius clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments he accepted their recommendations without exception they included john foster dulles and george m humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships and one woman oveta culp hobby eisenhower's cabinet consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader was dubbed by one journalist eight millionaires and a plumber[114] the cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends office seekers or experienced government administrators he also upgraded the role of the national security council in planning all phases of the cold war[115]
the president's official photograph prior to his inauguration he led a meeting of advisors at pearl harbor addressing foremost issues agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term to bring the korean war to an end to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent and to end price and wage controls[116] eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist russia policy his inaugural address as well was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the u n[117]
eisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any prior president holding almost 200 in his two terms while he saw a positive relationship with the press as invaluable his primary objective in press conferences was to maintain an indispensable direct contact with the people[118]
throughout his presidency eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism[119] he continued all the major new deal programs still in operation especially social security he expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency the department of health education and welfare while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers he implemented integration in the armed services in two years which had not been completed under truman[120]
as the 1954 congressional elections approached and it became evident that the republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses eisenhower was among those blaming the old guard for the losses and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the gop eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate progressive republican i have just one purpose&#160 and that is to build up a strong progressive republican party in this country if the right wing wants a fight they are going to get it&#160 before i end up either this republican party will reflect progressivism or i won't be with them anymore[121]
initially eisenhower planned on serving only one term but as with other decisions he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading republicans wanted him to run again during his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the gop's potential candidates the group in addition to his doctor concluded a second term was well advised and he announced in february 1956 he would run again[122][123] eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about nixon's repeating as the vice president on his ticket the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition he personally favored robert b anderson a democrat who rejected his offer eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party[124] in 1956 eisenhower faced adlai stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 576% of the popular vote the level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations[125]
eisenhower valued the brief respites and the amenities of an office which he endowed with an arduous daily schedule he made full use of his valet chauffeur and secretarial support�he rarely drove or dialed a phone number he was an avid fisherman golfer painter and bridge player and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment[126] on august 26 1959 eisenhower was aboard the maiden flight of air force one which replaced the previous presidential aircraft the columbine[127]

you can download the clip or download a player to play the clip in your browser president eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at cadillac square in detroit on october 29 1954
text of speech excerpt problems playing this file see media help one of eisenhower's enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the interstate highway system in 1956[128] he justified the project through the federal aid highway act of 1956 as essential to american security during the cold war it was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers
eisenhower's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the us army's 1919 transcontinental motor convoy he was assigned as an observer for the mission which involved sending a convoy of us army vehicles coast to coast[129][130] his subsequent experience with encountering german autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of world war ii convinced him of the benefits of an interstate highway system noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country he thought an interstate highway system in the us would not only be beneficial for military operations but provide a measure of continued economic growth[131] the legislation initially stalled in the congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by eisenhower in june 1956[132]
foreign policy[edit] eisenhower with indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru us president eisenhower visits taiwan and its president chiang kai-shek at taipei in 1953 the republican party's old guard presented eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the yalta agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the executive branch however the death of joseph stalin in march 1953 made the matter a practical moot point[133] at this time eisenhower gave his chance for peace speech in which he attempted unsuccessfully to forestall the nuclear arms race with the soviet union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials biographer stephen ambrose opined that this was the best speech of eisenhower's presidency[134][135]
nevertheless the cold war escalated during his presidency when the soviet union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late november 1955 eisenhower against the advice of dulles decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the soviets in an attempt to make their refusal more difficult he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses such as power generation this approach was labeled atoms for peace[136]
the un speech was well received but the soviets never acted upon it due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the us arsenal indeed eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons while reducing conventional forces and with them the overall defense budget a policy formulated as a result of project solarium and expressed in nsc 162/2 this approach became known as the new look and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953[137]
in 1955 american nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament the failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the russians to permit any sort of inspections in talks located in london that year they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections the tables were then turned on eisenhower when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the us to permit inspections in may of that year the russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to austria and paved the way for a geneva summit with the us uk and france[138] at the geneva conference eisenhower presented a proposal called open skies to facilitate disarmament which included plans for russia and the us to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure russian leader nikita khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand[139]
in 1954 eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in southeast asia and also in central america he believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in vietnam this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism from laos through malaysia and indonesia ultimately to india likewise the fall of guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring mexico[140] that year the loss of north vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed european defence community (edc) were serious defeats but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism saying long faces don't win wars[141] as he had threatened the french in their rejection of edc he afterwards moved to restore germany as a full nato partner[142]
with eisenhower's leadership and dulles' direction cia activities increased to resist the spread of communism in poorer countries[143] the cia in part deposed the leaders of iran in operation ajax of guatemala through operation pbsuccess and possibly the newly independent republic of the congo (l�opoldville)[144] in 1954 eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the soviet union with dulles' recommendation he authorized the deployment of thirty lockheed u-2's at a cost of $35 million[145] the eisenhower administration also planned the bay of pigs invasion to overthrow fidel castro in cuba which john f kennedy was left to carry out[146]
call-sign air force one[edit] over new york city in 1953 eastern airlines flight 8610 a commercial flight had a near miss with air force flight 8610 a lockheed c-121 constellation known as columbine ii while the latter was carrying president eisenhower prompting the adoption of the unique call sign air force one whenever the president was on board any us air force aircraft columbine ii is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display[147][148][149]
space race[edit] further information space race on the whole eisenhower's support of the nation's fledgling space program was modest until the soviet launch of sputnik in 1957 gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world he then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education he rushed construction of more advanced satellites created nasa as a civilian space agency signed a landmark science education law and fostered improved relations with american scientists[150]
in strategic terms it was eisenhower who devised the american basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of b-52 bombers land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) and polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles (slbms)[151]
korean war china and taiwan[edit] eisenhower in korea with general chung il-kwon and baik seon-yup 1952 in late 1952 eisenhower went to korea and discovered a military and political stalemate once in office when the chinese began a buildup in the kaesong sanctuary he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded his earlier military reputation in europe was effective with the chinese[152] the national security council the joint chiefs of staff and the strategic air command (sac) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against china[153] with the death of stalin in early march 1953 russian support for a chinese hard-line weakened and china decided to compromise on the prisoner issue[154]
in july 1953 an armistice took effect with korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 the armistice and boundary remain in effect today with american soldiers stationed there to guarantee it the armistice concluded despite opposition from secretary dulles south korean president syngman rhee and also within eisenhower's party has been described by biographer ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable and limited war unwinnable[154]
a point of emphasis in ike's campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment this remained his preference despite the armistice with korea[155] throughout his terms eisenhower took a hard-line attitude toward china as demanded by conservative republicans with the goal of driving a wedge between china and the soviet union[156]
eisenhower continued truman's policy of recognizing the republic of china (based in formosa/taiwan) as the legitimate government of china not the beijing regime there were localized flare-ups when the red army began shelling the islands of quemoy and matsu in september 1954 eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the chinese communists he thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded[157]
the sino-american mutual defense treaty with taiwan was signed in december 1954 he requested and secured from congress their formosa resolution in january 1955 which gave eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of formoso and the pescadores the resolution bolstered the morale of the chinese nationalists and signaled to beijing that the us was committed to holding the line[157]
eisenhower openly threatened the chinese with use of nuclear weapons authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled operation teapot nevertheless he left the chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response this allowed eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectives�the end of this communist encroachment the retention of the islands by the chinese nationalists and continued peace[158] defense of taiwan from an invasion remains a core american policy[159]
by the end of 1954 eisenhower's military and foreign policy experts�the nsc jcs and state dept�had unanimously urged him on no less than five occasions to launch an atomic attack against china yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace[160]
the middle east and eisenhower doctrine[edit] eisenhower with the shah mohammad reza pahlavi of iran 1959 even before he was inaugurated eisenhower accepted a request from the british government to restore the shah (mohammad reza pahlavi) to power he therefore authorized the central intelligence agency to overthrow prime minister mohammad mosaddegh[161] this resulted in an increased strategic control over iranian oil by us and british companies[162]
in november 1956 eisenhower forced an end to the combined british french and israeli invasion of egypt in response to the suez crisis receiving praise from egyptian president gamal abdel nasser simultaneously he condemned the brutal soviet invasion of hungary in response to the hungarian revolution of 1956 he publicly disavowed his allies at the united nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from egypt[163] eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against britain and france in his memoirs which were published in 1965[164]
eisenhower and vice president richard nixon with their host king saud of saudi arabia washington 1957 after the suez crisis the united states became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the middle east via the eisenhower doctrine designed by secretary of state dulles it held the us would be prepared to use armed force&#160 [to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism further the united states would provide economic and military aid and if necessary use military force to stop the spread of communism in the middle east[165]
eisenhower applied the doctrine in 1957�58 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the kingdom of jordan and by encouraging syria's neighbors to consider military operations against it more dramatically in july 1958 he sent 15000 marines and soldiers to lebanon as part of operation blue bat a non-combat peace-keeping mission to stabilize the pro-western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country[166]
the mission proved a success and the marines departed three months later the deployment came in response to the urgent request of lebanese president camille chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability weakened soviet influence and intimidated the egyptian and syrian governments whose anti-west political position had hardened after the suez crisis[166]
most arab countries were skeptical about the eisenhower doctrine because they considered zionist imperialism the real danger however they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons egypt and syria supported by the soviet union openly opposed the initiative however egypt received american aid until the six day war in 1967[167]
as the cold war deepened dulles sought to isolate the soviet union by building regional alliances of nations against it critics sometimes called it pacto-mania[168]
southeast asia[edit] early in 1953 the french asked eisenhower for help in french indochina against the communists supplied from china who were fighting the first indochina war eisenhower sent lt general john w iron mike o'daniel to vietnam to study and assess the french forces there[169] chief of staff matthew ridgway dissuaded the president from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary eisenhower stated prophetically that this war would absorb our troops by divisions[170]
eisenhower did provide france with bombers and non-combat personnel after a few months with no success by the french he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes further requests for assistance from the french were agreed to but only on conditions eisenhower knew were impossible to meet&#160� allied participation and congressional approval[171] when the french fortress of dien bien phu fell to the vietnamese communists in may 1954 eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the chairman of the joint chiefs the vice president and the head of ncs[172]
eisenhower responded to the french defeat with the formation of the seato (southeast asia treaty organization) alliance with the uk france new zealand and australia in defense of vietnam against communism at that time the french and chinese reconvened geneva peace talks eisenhower agreed the us would participate only as an observer after france and the communists agreed to a partition of vietnam eisenhower rejected the agreement offering military and economic aid to southern vietnam[173] ambrose argues that eisenhower by not participating in the geneva agreement had kept the us out of vietnam nevertheless with the formation of seato he had in the end put the us back into the conflict[174]
in late 1954 gen j lawton collins was made ambassador to free vietnam (the term south vietnam came into use in 1955) effectively elevating the country to sovereign status collins' instructions were to support the leader ngo dinh diem in subverting communism by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign[175] in february 1955 eisenhower dispatched the first american soldiers to vietnam as military advisors to diem's army after diem announced the formation of the republic of vietnam (rvn commonly known as south vietnam) in october eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military economic and technical assistance[176]
in the years that followed eisenhower increased the number of us military advisors in south vietnam to 900 men[177] this was due to north vietnam's support of uprisings in the south and concern the nation would fall[173] in may 1957 diem then president of south vietnam made a state visit to the united states for ten days president eisenhower pledged his continued support and a parade was held in diem's honor in new york city although diem was publicly praised in private secretary of state john foster dulles conceded that diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives[178]
after the election of november 1960 eisenhower in briefing with john f kennedy pointed out the communist threat in southeast asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration eisenhower told kennedy he considered laos the cork in the bottle with regard to the regional threat[179]
1960 u-2 incident[edit] main article 1960 u-2 incident a u-2 reconnaissance aircraft in flight on may 1 1960 a us one-man u-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over soviet union airspace the flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an east�west summit conference which had been scheduled in paris 15 days later[180] captain francis gary powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto russian soil four days after powers disappeared the eisenhower administration had nasa issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had gone missing north of turkey it speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged and falsely claimed that the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties[181]
soviet premier nikita khrushchev announced that a spy-plane had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot as a result the eisenhower administration thinking the pilot had died in the crash authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a weather research aircraft which had unintentionally strayed into soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed difficulties with his oxygen equipment while flying over turkey[182] the soviets put captain powers on trial and displayed parts of the u-2 which had been recovered almost fully intact[183]
the 1960 four power paris summit between president dwight eisenhower nikita khrushchev harold macmillan and charles de gaulle collapsed because of the incident eisenhower refused to accede to khrushchev's demands that he apologize therefore khrushchev would not take part in the summit up until this event eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the soviet union nuclear arms reduction and berlin were to have been discussed at the summit eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that stupid u-2 business[183]
the affair was an embarrassment for united states prestige further the senate foreign relations committee held a lengthy inquiry into the u-2 incident[183] in russia captain powers made a forced confession and apology on august 19 1960 powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment on february 10 1962 powers was exchanged for rudolf abel in berlin and returned to the us[181]
civil rights[edit] while president truman had begun the process of desegregating the armed forces in 1948 actual implementation had been slow eisenhower made clear his stance in his first state of the union address in february 1953 saying i propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the president to end segregation in the district of columbia including the federal government and any segregation in the armed forces[184] when he encountered opposition from the services he used government control of military spending to force the change through stating wherever federal funds are expended&#160 i do not see how any american can justify&#160 a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds[185]
when robert b anderson eisenhower's first secretary of the navy argued that the us navy must recognize the customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the navy had no part in creating eisenhower overruled him we have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step there must be no second class citizens in this country[186]
the administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue as communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the us as a point of propaganda attack[187]
eisenhower told district of columbia officials to make washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children[188][189] he proposed to congress the civil rights act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law the 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the justice department and a civil rights commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875[190]
in 1957 the state of arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the brown decision eisenhower demanded that arkansas governor orval faubus obey the court order when faubus balked the president placed the arkansas national guard under federal control and sent in the 101st airborne division they escorted and protected nine black students' entry to little rock central high school an all-white public school for the first time since the reconstruction era[191] martin luther king jr wrote to eisenhower to thank him for his actions writing the overwhelming majority of southerners negro and white stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in little rock[192]
relations with congress[edit] eisenhower had a republican congress for only his first two years in office in the senate the republican majority was by a one-vote margin senator robert a taft assisted the president greatly in working with the old guard and was sorely missed when his death (in july 1953) left eisenhower with his successor william knowland whom eisenhower disliked[193]
this prevented eisenhower from openly condemning joseph mccarthy's highly criticized methods against communism to facilitate relations with congress eisenhower decided to ignore mccarthy's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the white house this position drew criticism from a number of corners[194] in late 1953 mccarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 senate elections eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists[195] nevertheless he refused
among ike's objectives in not directly confronting mccarthy was to prevent mccarthy from dragging the atomic energy commission (aec) into mccarthy's witch hunt for communists which would interfere with and perhaps delay the aec's important work on h-bombs the administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the aec j robert oppenheimer had urged that the h-bomb work be delayed eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance though he knew this would create fertile ground for mccarthy[196]
in may 1955 mccarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to white house personnel eisenhower was furious and issued an order as follows it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters&#160 it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications or any documents or reproductions concerning such advice be disclosed this was an unprecedented step by eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege ike's denial of mccarthy's access to his staff reduced mccarthy's hearings to rants about trivial matters and contributed to his ultimate downfall[197]
in early 1954 the old guard put forward a constitutional amendment called the bricker amendment which would curtail international agreements by the chief executive such as the yalta agreements eisenhower opposed the measure[198] the old guard agreed with eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises which the democrats opposed the president succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the aec[199]
the democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election[200] eisenhower had to work with the democratic majority leader lyndon b johnson (later us president) in the senate and speaker sam rayburn in the house both from texas joe martin the republican speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 wrote that eisenhower never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill there were exceptions leonard w hall for example who as chairman of the republican national committee tried to open the administration's eyes to the political facts of life with occasional success however these exceptions were not enough to right the balance[201]
speaker martin concluded that eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with congress with results often the reverse of what he has desired because members of congress resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the white house without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'the chief wants this' the administration never made use of many republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking[201]

earl warren 1953 (chief justice) john marshall harlan ii 1954 william j brennan 1956 charles evans whittaker 1957 potter stewart 1958 whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired stewart and harlan were conservative republicans while brennan was a democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism[202] in selecting a chief justice eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives noting privately that warren represents the kind of political economic and social thinking that i believe we need on the supreme court&#160 he has a national name for integrity uprightness and courage that again i believe we need on the court[203] in the next few years warren led the court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the court
other courts[edit] main article dwight d eisenhower judicial appointments in addition to his five supreme court appointments eisenhower appointed 45 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 129 judges to the united states district courts
states admitted to the union[edit] alaska&#160� january 3 1959 49th state hawaii&#160� august 21 1959 50th state health issues[edit] eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at west point often two or three packs a day eisenhower stated that he gave [himself] an order to stop cold turkey in march 1949 while at columbia[46][204] he was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office[205] on september 24 1955 while vacationing in colorado he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks' hospitalization during which time nixon dulles and sherman adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the president[206] he was treated by dr paul dudley white a cardiologist with a national reputation who regularly informed the press of the president's progress instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as president his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery[207]
as a consequence of his heart attack eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on november 25 1957 this incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand the stroke had caused an aphasia the president also suffered from crohn's disease[208] chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine[209] which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on june 9 1956[210] to treat the intestinal block surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine[211] his scheduled meeting with indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in gettysburg pennsylvania[212] he was still recovering from this operation during the suez crisis eisenhower's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits but he still indulged in alcohol during a visit to england he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on august 29 1959 however before dinner at chequers on the next day his doctor general howard snyder recalled eisenhower drank several gin-and-tonics and one or two gins on the rocks&#160 three or four wines with the dinner[213]
the last three years of eisenhower's second term in office were ones of relatively good health eventually after leaving the white house he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks[214] a severe heart attack in august 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs[215] in august 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis for which he underwent surgery on december 12 1966 when his gallbladder was removed containing 16 gallstones[214] after eisenhower's death in 1969 (see below) an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma[216] a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the president more vulnerable to heart disease eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death[214]
