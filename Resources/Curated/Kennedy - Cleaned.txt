v t e john fitzgerald jack kennedy (may 29 1917 � november 22 1963) commonly referred to by his initials jfk was an american politician who served as the 35th president of the united states from january 1961 until his assassination in november 1963 the nuclear test ban treaty the establishment of the peace corps developments in the space race the building of the berlin wall the civil rights movement and increased us involvement in the vietnam war all took place during his presidency
kennedy's time in office is also marked by high tensions with communist states and cuba in particular an attempt in april 1961 to overthrow the country's dictator fidel castro was thwarted by armed forces within three days his administration subsequently rejected plans by the joint chiefs of staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on american soil in order to gain public approval for a war against cuba in october 1962 it was discovered soviet ballistic missiles had been deployed in cuba the resulting period of unease often termed the cuban missile crisis is seen by many historians as the closest the human race has ever come to nuclear war
after military service as commander of pt boats pt-109 and pt-59 during world war ii in the south pacific kennedy represented massachusetts's 11th congressional district in the us house of representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a democrat thereafter he served in the us senate from that state from 1953 until 1960 kennedy defeated vice president and republican candidate richard nixon in the 1960 us presidential election at age 43 he was the youngest man to have been elected to the office[2][a] the second-youngest president (after theodore roosevelt who was 42 when he became president after the assassination of william mckinley) kennedy was the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president[3] to date[update] kennedy has been the only roman catholic president and the only president to have won a pulitzer prize[4]
kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas on november 22 1963 lee harvey oswald was arrested that afternoon and charged with the crime that night jack ruby shot and killed oswald two days later before oswald could be prosecuted the fbi and the warren commission officially concluded that oswald was the lone assassin the united states house select committee on assassinations (hsca) agreed with the conclusion that oswald fired the shots that killed the president but also concluded that kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy[5]
since the 1960s information concerning kennedy's private life has come to light details of kennedy's health problems with which he struggled have become better known especially since the 1990s although initially kept secret from the general public reports of kennedy being unfaithful in marriage have garnered much press kennedy ranks highly in historians' polls of us presidents although a slight gap exists between his public reputation and his standing among academics[6] with the public generally more commendatory

military service (1941�45) main article motor torpedo boat pt-109 lieutenant (junior grade) john f kennedy (standing at right) with his pt-109 crew 1943 in september 1941 after medical disqualification by the army for his chronic lower back problems kennedy joined the us navy with the influence of the director of the office of naval intelligence former naval attach� to joseph kennedy[22] kennedy was an ensign serving in the office of the secretary of the navy when the attack on pearl harbor occurred he attended the naval reserve officer training corps and then voluntarily entered the motor torpedo boat squadrons training center in melville rhode island[23] his first command was pt-101 from december 7 1942 until february 23 1943 it was a pt boat used for training while kennedy was an instructor at melville[24] he then led three huckins pt boats�pt-98 pt-99 and pt-101 which were being relocated from mtbron 4 in melville rhode island back to jacksonville florida and the new mtbron 14 (formed february 17 1943) during the transit south he was briefly hospitalized in jacksonville after diving in the cold water to unfoul a propeller thereafter he was assigned duty in panama and later in the pacific theater where kennedy earned the rank of lieutenant eventually commanding two more patrol torpedo (pt) boats[25]
kennedy on his navy patrol boat the pt-109 on august 2 1943 kennedy's boat the pt-109 along with the pt-162 and the pt-169 was performing nighttime patrols near new georgia in the solomon islands[26] when pt-109 was rammed by the japanese destroyer amagiri[27] kennedy gathered his surviving crew members together in the water around the wreckage to vote on whether to fight or surrender kennedy stated there's nothing in the book about a situation like this a lot of you men have families and some of you have children what do you want to do i have nothing to lose shunning surrender the men swam towards a small island[28]
kennedy despite re-injury to his back in the collision towed a badly burned crewman through the water with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth[29] he towed the wounded man to the island and later to a second island from where his crew was subsequently rescued[30] for these actions kennedy received the navy and marine corps medal with the following citation
for extremely heroic conduct as commanding officer of motor torpedo boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the pacific war theater on august 1�2 1943 unmindful of personal danger lieutenant (then lieutenant junior grade) kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore his outstanding courage endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the united states naval service
in october 1943 kennedy took command of a pt boat converted into a gunboat pt-59 which took part in a marine rescue on choiseul island that november[31] kennedy then left the pt-59 and returned to the united states in early january 1944 after receiving treatment for his back injury he was released from active duty in late 1944[32]
beginning in january 1945 kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at castle hot springs a resort and temporary military hospital in arizona[33][34] kennedy was honorably discharged just prior to japan's surrender in 1945 kennedy's other decorations in world war ii included the purple heart american defense service medal american campaign medal asiatic-pacific campaign medal with three bronze service stars and the world war ii victory medal[1] when later asked how he became a war hero kennedy joked it was easy they cut my pt boat in half[35]
in april 1945 kennedy's father who was a friend of william randolph hearst arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for hearst newspapers the assignment kept kennedy's name in the public eye and expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career[36] he worked as a correspondent that may covering the potsdam conference and other events[37]
congressional career us house of representatives (1947�1953) while kennedy was still serving his older brother joe jr was killed in action over the english channel during world war ii because his eldest brother had been the family's political standard-bearer and tapped by his father to seek the presidency his death changed that course and the task now fell to kennedy[38]
in 1946 us representative james michael curley vacated his seat in the strongly democratic 11th congressional district in massachusetts�at the urging of kennedy's father�to become mayor of boston kennedy ran for the seat beating his republican opponent by a large margin in november 1946[39] he served as a congressman for six years
us senate (1953�1960) kennedy lying on a gurney following spinal surgery accompanied by his wife december 1954 in the 1952 us senate election kennedy defeated incumbent republican henry cabot lodge ii for the us senate seat the following year he married jacqueline bouvier[40]
kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years often absent from the senate he was at times critically ill and received catholic last rites during his convalescence in 1956 he published profiles in courage a book about us senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in 1957[41] rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter ted sorensen were confirmed in sorensen's 2008 autobiography[42]
at the 1956 democratic national convention presidential nominee adlai stevenson let the convention select the vice presential nominee kennedy finished second in the balloting losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee kennedy received national exposure from that episode his father thought it just as well that kennedy lost due to the potential political debility of his catholicism and the strength of the eisenhower ticket
one of the matters demanding kennedy's attention in the senate was president eisenhower's bill for the civil rights act of 1957[43] kennedy cast a procedural vote on this which was considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill[43] kennedy did vote for title iii of the act which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin but majority leader lyndon b johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure[44] kennedy also voted for title iv termed the jury trial amendment many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act[45] a final compromise bill which kennedy supported was passed in september 1957[46]
jack paar interviews senator kennedy on the tonight show (1959) in 1958 kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the senate defeating his republican opponent boston lawyer vincent j celeste by a wide margin it was during his re-election campaign that kennedy's press secretary at this time robert e thompson put together a film entitled the us senator john f kennedy story which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner-workings of his office it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time[47]
while kennedy's father was a strong supporter of senator joseph mccarthy mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family as well bobby kennedy worked for mccarthy's subcommittee and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia in 1954 the senate voted to censure mccarthy and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure the speech however was not delivered because of kennedy's hospitalization at the time the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted the episode damaged kennedy's support among members of the liberal community including eleanor roosevelt in the 1956 and 1960 elections[48]
1960 presidential election main article united states presidential election 1960 john f kennedy and richard nixon participate in the first televised presidential debate in washington dc in 1960 on january 2 1960 kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the democratic primary election where he faced challenges from senator hubert humphrey of minnesota and senator wayne morse of oregon kennedy defeated humphrey in wisconsin and west virginia morse in maryland and oregon as well as token opposition (often write-in candidates) in new hampshire indiana and nebraska
kennedy visited a coal mine in west virginia most miners and others in that predominantly conservative protestant state were quite wary of kennedy's roman catholicism his victory in west virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal
at the democratic convention he gave his well-known new frontier speech saying for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won�and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises�it is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them[49]
with humphrey and morse eliminated kennedy's main opponent at the los angeles convention was senator lyndon b johnson of texas kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones from adlai stevenson (the democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956) stuart symington and several favorite sons and on july 13 the democratic convention nominated kennedy as its candidate kennedy asked johnson to be his vice presidential candidate despite opposition from many liberal delegates and kennedy's own staff including his brother bobby[50]
the kennedys campaigning in appleton wisconsin march 1960 kennedy needed johnson's strength in the south to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since 1916 major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedy's roman catholicism cuba and whether the soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decision-making he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september 12 1960 i am not the catholic candidate for president i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public matters&#160� and the church does not speak for me[51] kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were catholic and once stated that no one asked me my religion [serving the navy] in the south pacific[52]
outgoing president dwight d eisenhower meets with president-elect john f kennedy on december 6 1960 during the campaign kennedy sought a meeting with rabbi menachem m schneerson at his office on brooklyn kennedy was turned down as the rabbi was already meeting a group of simple men and women that evening[53][54]
in september and october kennedy appeared with republican candidate richard nixon then vice president in the first televised us presidential debates in us history during these programs nixon with a sore injured leg and his five o'clock shadow was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable while kennedy choosing to avail himself of makeup services appeared relaxed leading the huge television audience to favor kennedy as the winner radio listeners either thought nixon had won or that the debates were a draw[55] the debates are now considered a milestone in american political history�the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics[41]
kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls on november 8 kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century in the national popular vote kennedy led nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (497% to 495%) while in the electoral college he won 303 votes to nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win)[56]
fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma[56] kennedy was the youngest man elected president succeeding eisenhower who was then the oldest (ronald reagan surpassed eisenhower as the oldest president in 1981)[57]
presidency (1961�1963) wikisource has original text related to this article john f kennedy's inaugural address see also timeline of the presidency of john f kennedy this section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions (april 2015) john f kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on january 20 1961 in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens famously saying ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself[58]
john f kennedy takes the oath of office administered by chief justice earl warren on january 20 1961 at the capitol he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us begin in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you[58]
john f kennedy speaking at rice university on september 12 1962 the address reflected kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration[59]
kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-general eisenhower and he wasted no time in dismantling eisenhower's methods[60] kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet we can learn our jobs together he stated[61]
much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda[62] the president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism and kennedy abruptly cut him off asking what do you want me to do about that today[63]
kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the f-111 tfx (tactical fighter experimental) fighter-bomber to general dynamics (the choice of the civilian defense department) over boeing (the choice of the military)[64] at the request of senator henry jackson senator john mcclellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february�november 1963[65]
foreign policy main article foreign policy of the john f kennedy administration foreign trips of john f kennedy during his presidency president kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war in 1961 kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the president started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early 1961 the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june 1961[66]
on the way to the summit kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle who advised kennedy to ignore khrushchev's abrasive style the french president feared the united states' presumed influence in europe nevertheless de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris[67]
kennedy with kwame nkrumah the first head of an independent ghana march 1961 on june 4 1961 the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received khrushchev for his part was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him weak kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin he made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war[68]
persian shah mohammad reza pahlavi kennedy and us defense secretary robert mcnamara in the white house cabinet room on april 13 1962 shortly after the president returned home the ussr announced its intention to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city kennedy depressed and angry assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring[69]
in the weeks immediately after the vienna summit more than 20000 people fled from east berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the ussr kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies[70] in a july 1961 speech kennedy announced his decision to add $325&#160billion to the defense budget along with over 200000 additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us the speech received an 85% approval rating[71]
the following month the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this as long as free access from west to east berlin continued this course was altered when it was learned that the west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states kennedy sent vice president johnson along with a host of military personnel in convoy through west germany including soviet-armed checkpoints to demonstrate the continued commitment of the us to west berlin[72]
kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may 5 1960 regarding america's conduct in the emerging cold war the address detailed how american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying that for we too founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule[73]
cuba and the bay of pigs invasion main article bay of pigs invasion president kennedy and vice president johnson take a leisurely stroll on the white house grounds the prior eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow the fidel castro regime in cuba the plan led by the central intelligence agency (cia) with help from the us military was for an invasion of cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of us-trained anti-castro cuban exiles[74][75] led by cia paramilitary officers the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people in hopes of removing castro from power[76]
on april 17 1961 kennedy ordered what became known as the bay of pigs invasion 1500 us-trained cubans called brigade 2506 landed on the island no us air support was provided allen dulles director of the cia later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground[77]
by april 19 1961 the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1189 survivors after twenty months cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53&#160million worth of food and medicine[78] the incident made castro wary of the us and led him to believe another invasion would occur[79]
according to biographer richard reeves kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations when it failed he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad[80] he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it but maybe we'll learn something from it[81]
in late 1961 the white house formed the special group (augmented) headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others the group's objective�to overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tactics�was never pursued[82]
cuban missile crisis main article cuban missile crisis on october 14 1962 cia u-2 spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites being built in cuba by the soviets the photos were shown to kennedy on october 16 a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat[83]
meeting with soviet premier nikita khrushchev in vienna in 1961 kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the ussr but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit[84]

the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october 24 the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail[88] united nations (un) secretary general u thant requested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period khrushchev said yes but kennedy said no[89]
one soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded on october 28 khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections[90] the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm-27 polaris missiles[91]
this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since in the end the humanity of the two men prevailed[92] the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the president's credibility kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter[93]

in may 1961 he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnam's president ngo dinh diem johnson assured diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists[103] kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem in defeat of communism in south vietnam[104]
kennedy initially followed eisenhower's lead using limited military action to fight the communist forces led by ho chi minh[105] he continued policies that provided political economic and military support to the south vietnamese government[105] late in 1961 the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh[106] kennedy increased the number of helicopters military advisors and undeclared us special forces in the area but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops[107][108]
in late 1961 president kennedy sent roger hilsman then director of the state department's bureau of intelligence and research to assess the situation in vietnam there hilsman met sir robert thompson head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam and the concept of the strategic hamlet program was formed it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem it was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation village internment and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents it was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government by november 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964[109]
in early 1962 kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum&#160� subversive insurgency (war of liberation)[110] secretary of state dean rusk voiced strong support for us involvement[111] operation ranch hand a large-scale aerial defoliation effort began on the roadsides of south vietnam[112][b]
kennedy with future australian prime minister harold holt in the oval office in 1963 in april 1963 kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam we don't have a prayer of staying in vietnam those people hate us they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point but i can't give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to re-elect me[113] kennedy faced a crisis in vietnam by july despite increased us support the south vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro-communist viet cong forces
on august 21 just as the new us ambassador henry cabot lodge jr arrived diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces funded and trained by the cia to quell buddhist demonstrations the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'�tat to remove diem with (or perhaps by) his brother nhu[114] lodge was instructed to try to get diem and nhu to step down and leave the country diem would not listen to lodge[115]
cable 243 (deptel 243) dated august 24 followed declaring washington would no longer tolerate nhu's actions and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu if diem refused the americans would explore alternative leadership[116] lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu as originally planned[117]
at week's end kennedy learned from lodge that the diem government might due to france's assistance to nhu be dealing secretly with the communists�and might ask the americans to leave orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables[118] at the same time the first formal anti-vietnam war sentiment was expressed by us clergy from the ministers' vietnam committee[119]
a white house meeting in september was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the department of defense (general victor krulak) and the state department (joseph mendenhall) krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any us influence kennedy reacted saying did you two gentlemen visit the same country the president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight[120]
in october 1963 the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d taylor to a vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from us representatives in vietnam[121] in meetings with mcnamara taylor and lodge diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the us helping to dispel mcnamara's previous optimism about diem[122]
taylor and mcnamara were also enlightened by vietnam's vice president nguyen ngoc tho (choice of many to succeed diem should a coup occur) who in detailed terms obliterated taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside[123] at kennedy's insistence the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals 1000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965 something the nsc considered a strategic fantasy[124] the final report declared that the military was making progress that the increasingly unpopular diem-led government was not vulnerable to a coup and that an assassination of diem or nhu was a possibility[125]
in late october intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot the source vietnamese general duong van minh (also known as big minh) wanted to know the us position kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup excluding assassination and to ensure deniability by the us[126] later that month as the coup became imminent kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him a policy of control and cut out was initiated to insure presidential control of us responses while cutting him out of the paper trail[127]
on november 1 1963 south vietnamese generals led by big minh overthrew the diem government arresting and then killing diem and nhu kennedy was shocked by the deaths he found out afterwards that minh had asked the cia field office to secure safe-passage out of the country for diem and nhu but was told that 24 hours were needed to procure a plane minh responded that he could not hold them that long[128]
news of the coup initially led to renewed confidence�both in america and in south vietnam�that the war might be won[129] mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia before leaving for dallas kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year&#160 [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option including how to get out of there&#160 to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top when asked what he thought the president meant forrestal said it was devil's advocate stuff[130]
historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated had kennedy survived and been re-elected in 1964[131] fueling the debate are statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of vietnam after the 1964 election[132] the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw a position that johnson disagreed with[133] kennedy had signed national security action memorandum (nsam) 263 dated october 11 which ordered the withdrawal of 1000 military personnel by the end of the year[134][135] such an action would have been a policy reversal but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at american university on june 10 1963[136]
when robert kennedy was asked in 1964 what his brother would have done if the south vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat he replied we'd face that when we came to it[137] at the time of kennedy's death no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam[138] us involvement in the region escalated until lyndon johnson his successor directly deployed regular us military forces for fighting the vietnam war[139][140] after kennedy's assassination president johnson passed nsam 273 on november 26 1963 it reversed kennedy's decision to withdraw 1000 troops and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese[141][142]

kennedy delivering his speech in west berlin wikisource has original text related to this article jfk's ich bin ein berliner speech on june 26 president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin reiterating the american commitment to germany and criticizing communism he was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience[152]
kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner (i am a citizen of berlin) a million people were on the street for the speech[152] he remarked to ted sorensen afterwards we'll never have another day like this one as long as we live[153]
israel in 1960 kennedy stated israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom[154]
subsequently as president kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel and he is credited as the founder of the us-israeli military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents) kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' (as he described it to golda meir) between the us and israel[155]
kennedy (right) with israeli foreign minister golda meir december 27 1962 kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in 1962 and beginning in 1963 was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry (the mim-23 hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies which were opposed by arab neighbours such as its water project on the jordan river[156]
as result of this newly created security alliance kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials in dimona which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the middle east after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government david ben-gurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december 21 1960 that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna[157] when ben-gurion met with kennedy in new york he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being[157]
when kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated in a may 1963 letter to ben-gurion that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming ben-gurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency (iaea) inspections in 1962 the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime a science attach� at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited[158]
according to seymour hersh the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on [an inspection][158] hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance and with the full acquiescence of israel[159] marc trachtenberg argued although well aware of what the israelis were doing kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with america's non-proliferation policy[160] the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israel's nuclear weapons program[161]
rodger davies the director of the state department's office of near eastern affairs concluded in march 1965 that israel was developing nuclear weapons he reported that israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968�69[162] on may 1 1968 undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year the state department argued that if israel wanted arms it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program[158] dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt) into contracts for the supply of us weapons continued throughout 1968[163]
iraq main article ramadan revolution in 1963 the kennedy administration backed the coup against the government of iraq headed by abd al-karim qasim who five years earlier had deposed the western-allied iraqi monarchy[164] on february 8 1963 kennedy received a memo stating we will make informal friendly noises as soon as we can find out whom to talk with and ought to recognize as soon as we're sure these guys are firmly in the saddle cia had excellent reports on the plotting but i doubt either they or uk should claim much credit for it[165] the cia had planned to remove qasim in the past but those efforts did not come to fruition[166]
the new government led by president abdul salam arif and dominated by the ba'ath party (along with a coalition of nasserists and iraqi nationalists) used lists�possibly provided by the cia�of suspected communists and other leftists to systematically murder unknown numbers of iraq's educated elite[167][168] after a power struggle with the ba'athist prime minister ahmed hassan al-bakr arif purged the ba'ath party from the government[169] former cia officer james chritchfield disputed the notion that the cia offered active support to the coup plotters arguing that while well-informed on the first coup it was surprised by the power struggles that followed[170]
ireland john f kennedy visiting the john barry memorial at crescent quay in wexford ireland president kennedy in motorcade in patrick street cork in ireland on june 28 1963 during his four-day visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june 1963[171] kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college dublin[172] he visited the cottage at dunganstown near new ross county wexford where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america[173]

nuclear test ban treaty main article partial nuclear test ban treaty troubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty originally conceived in adlai stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign[176] in their vienna summit meeting in june 1961 khrushchev and kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september the united states responded by conducting tests five days later[177] shortly thereafter new us satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race[178] nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the ussr perceived themselves to be at parity[179]
in july 1963 kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets[180] the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance[181]
ultimately the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but not underground the us senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october 1963 france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses[182]
domestic policy president kennedy in fort worth texas on friday morning november 22 1963 kennedy called his domestic program the new frontier it ambitiously promised federal funding for education medical care for the elderly economic aid to rural regions and government intervention to halt the recession kennedy also promised an end to racial discrimination[183]
in his 1963 state of the union address he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20�90% to a range of 14�65% he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47% kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners[183] congress did not act until 1964 after his death when the top individual rate was lowered to 70% and the top corporate rate was set at 48% (see revenue act of 1964)[184]
to the economic club of new york he spoke in 1963 of &#160the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now[185] congress passed few of kennedy's major programs during his lifetime but did vote them through in 1964�65 under his successor johnson[186]
economy kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy[187] he presided over the first government budget to top the $100&#160billion mark in 1962 and his first budget in 1961 led to the country's first non-war non-recession deficit[188] the economy which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office accelerated notably during his presidency despite low inflation and interest rates gdp had grown by an average of only 22% per annum during the eisenhower presidency (scarcely more than population growth at the time) and had declined by 1% during eisenhower's last twelve months in office[189]
the economy turned around and prospered during the kennedy administration gdp expanded by an average of 55% from early 1961 to late 1963[189] while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased[190] industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales rose by 40%[191] this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until around 1969 and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time[189]
bobby kennedy stated we're going for broke their expense accounts where they've been and what they've been doing the fbi is to interview them all we can't lose this[192]
robert took the position that the steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices the administration's actions influenced us steel to rescind the price increase[193] the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted by naked power by threats by agents of the state security police[194] yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict us steel for collusion so quickly[194]
a new york times editorial praised kennedy's actions and said that the steel industry's price increase imperils the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation[195] nevertheless the administration's bureau of budget reported the price increase would have resulted in a net gain for gdp as well as a net budget surplus[196] the stock market which had steadily declined since kennedy's election dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry[197]
federal and military death penalty as president kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v georgia a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions[198] victor feguer was sentenced to death by a federal court in iowa and was executed on march 15 1963[199] kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february 12 1962 changing the penalty to life in prison[200]

civil rights the turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south[203] the supreme court of the united states had ruled in 1954 in brown v board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional many schools especially in southern states did not obey the supreme court's decision the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses restaurants theaters courtrooms bathrooms and beaches) but it continued nonetheless[204]
kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights during the 1960 campaign he telephoned coretta scott king wife of the reverend martin luther king jr who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained king's release from prison which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy[204]
in his first state of the union address in january 1961 president kennedy said the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race - at the ballot box and elsewhere - disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage[205] kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress which was dominated by conservative southern democrats and he distanced himself from it[206]
kennedy also was more concerned with other issues early in his presidency such as the cold war bay of pigs fiasco and the situation in southeast asia as articulated by brother robert the administration's early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess many civil rights leaders viewed kennedy as lukewarm especially concerning the freedom riders who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south and who were repeatedly met with violence by whites including law enforcement officers both federal and state kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders as an alternative to using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents robert kennedy speaking for the president urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts[207]
on march 6 1961 kennedy signed executive order 10925 which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin[208] it established the president's committee on equal employment opportunity displeased with the pace of kennedy's addressing the issue of segregation martin luther king jr and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation - kennedy did not execute the order[209]
in september 1962 james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering attorney general robert kennedy responded by sending 400 federal marshals while president kennedy reluctantly sent 3000 troops after the situation on campus turned violent[210] the ole miss riot of 1962 left two dead and dozens injured but meredith did finally enroll in his first class the instigating subculture at the old miss riot and at many other racially ignited events was the ku klux klan[211] on november 20 1962 kennedy signed executive order 11063 prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities[212]
in early 1963 kennedy related to martin luther king jr about the prospects for civil rights legislation if we get into a long fight over this in congress it will bottleneck everything else and we will still get no bill[213] civil rights clashes were on the rise that year[214] brother robert and ted sorenson pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front[215]
president kennedy's civil rights address june 11 1963 on june 11 1963 president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students vivian malone and james hood from attending wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama national guard which had just been federalized by order of the president that evening kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio launching his initiative for civil rights legislation�to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities and greater protection of voting rights[216][217]
his proposals became part of the civil rights act of 1964 the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader medgar evers in front of his home in mississippi[218] as the president had predicted the day after his tv speech and in reaction to it house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia (area redevelopment administration) had been defeated primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans[219]
