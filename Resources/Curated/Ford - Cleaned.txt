leslie lynch king jr (later known as gerald r ford) in 1916 ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother[5] james m cannon a member of the ford administration wrote in a biography of the late president that the kings' separation and divorce were sparked when a few days after ford's birth leslie king took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife his infant son and ford's nursemaid ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man[6]
after two and a half years with her parents on february 1 1916 dorothy married gerald rudolff ford a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company they then called her son gerald rudolff ford jr the future president was never formally adopted and did not legally change his name until december 3 1935 he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name[7] he was raised in grand rapids with his three half brothers from his mother's second marriage thomas gardner ford (1918�1995) richard addison ford (born 1924) and james francis ford (1927�2001)
ford also had three half-siblings from his father's second marriage marjorie king (1921�1993) leslie henry king (1923�1976) and patricia jane king (born 1925) they never saw one another as children and he did not know them at all ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17 when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth that year his biological father leslie king whom ford described as a carefree well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son approached ford while he was waiting tables in a grand rapids restaurant the two maintained a sporadic contact until leslie king sr's death[5][8]
ford maintained his distance emotionally saying my stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful so i couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing[9]
scouting and athletics[edit] eagle scout gerald ford (circled in red) in 1929 michigan governor fred w green at far left holding hat ford as a center on the university of michigan football team 1933 ford was involved in the boy scouts of america and earned that program's highest rank eagle scout[10] in later years ford received the distinguished eagle scout award in may 1970 and silver buffalo award from the boy scouts of america he is the only eagle scout to have ascended to the us presidency[10] scouting was so important to ford that his family asked that scouts participate in his funeral about 400 eagle scouts were part of the funeral procession where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum a few selected scouts served as ushers inside the national cathedral[11]
ford attended grand rapids south high school and was a star athlete and captain of his football team[12] in 1930 he was selected to the all-city team of the grand rapids city league he also attracted the attention of college recruiters[9]
attending the university of michigan as an undergraduate ford played center linebacker and long snapper for the school's football team[13] and helped the wolverines to undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933 the team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year however winning only one game ford was the team's star nonetheless and after a game during which michigan held heavily favored minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half assistant coach bennie oosterbaan later said when i walked into the dressing room at halftime i had tears in my eyes i was so proud of them ford and [cedric] sweet played their hearts out they were everywhere on defense ford later recalled during 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics i often thought of the experiences before during and after that game in 1934 remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation take action and make every effort possible despite adverse odds his teammates later voted ford their most valuable player with one assistant coach noting they felt jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause[14]
during ford's senior year a controversy developed when the georgia tech yellow jackets refused to play a scheduled game if a black player named willis ward took the field even after protests from students players and alumni university officials opted to keep ward out of the game ford was ward's best friend on the team and they roomed together while on road trips ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university�s decision but eventually agreed to play against georgia tech when ward personally asked him to play[15]
during the same season in a game against the university of chicago ford became the only future us president to tackle a future heisman trophy winner when he brought down running back jay berwanger who would win the first heisman the following year[16] in 1934 ford was selected for the eastern team on the shriner's east west crippled children game at san francisco (a benefit for crippled children) played on january 1 1935 as part of the 1935 collegiate all-star football team ford played against the chicago bears in the chicago college all-star game at soldier field[17] in honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career the university of michigan retired ford's no 48 jersey in 1994 with the blessing of the ford family it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the michigan football legends program and issued to sophomore linebacker desmond morgan before a home game against illinois on october 13[18]
ford remained interested in football and his school throughout life occasionally attending games ford also visited with players and coaches during practices at one point asking to join the players in the huddle[19] ford often had the naval band play the university of michigan fight song the victors before state events instead of hail to the chief[20] he also selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the us capitol[21] on his death in december 2006 the university of michigan marching band played the fight song for him one final time for his last ride from the gerald r ford airport in grand rapids michigan[22]

ford hoped to attend yale's law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities he spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the university of michigan law school[26] and was eventually admitted in spring 1938 to yale law school[27] ford earned his llb degree in 1941 (later amended to juris doctor) graduating in the top 25 percent of his class his introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in wendell willkie's presidential campaign
while attending yale law school he joined a group of students led by r douglas stuart jr and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 neutrality act the petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the america first committee a group determined to keep the us out of world war ii[28]
ford graduated from law school in 1941 and was admitted to the michigan bar shortly thereafter in may 1941 he opened a grand rapids law practice with a friend philip w buchen[25] who would later serve as ford's white house counsel but overseas developments caused a change in plans and ford responded to the attack on pearl harbor by enlisting in the navy[29]

ford serving as general quarters officer of the deck was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire he did so safely and reported his findings back to the ship�s commanding officer captain stuart ingersoll the ship�s crew was able to contain the fire and the ship got underway again[31]

marriage and children[edit] the fords on their wedding day october 15 1948 on october 15 1948 at grace episcopal church in grand rapids ford married elizabeth bloomer warren (1918�2011) a department store fashion consultant warren had been a john robert powers fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the martha graham dance company she had previously been married to and divorced from william g warren
at the time of his engagement ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the united states house of representatives the wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because as the new york times reported in a 1974 profile of betty ford jerry was running for congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer[35]
the couple had four children
michael gerald born in 1950 john gardner known as jack born in 1952 steven meigs born in 1956 susan elizabeth born in 1957 house of representatives[edit] a billboard for ford's 1948 congressional campaign after returning to grand rapids ford became active in local republican politics and supporters urged him to take on bartel j jonkman the incumbent republican congressman military service had changed his view of the world i came back a converted internationalist ford wrote and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed dedicated isolationist and i thought he ought to be replaced nobody thought i could win i ended up winning two to one[9]
during his first campaign in 1948 ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked[36] ford also visited local farms where in one instance a wager resulted in ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory[37] ford was known to his colleagues in the house as a congressman's congressman[38]
ford was a member of the house of representatives for 25 years holding the grand rapids congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973 it was a tenure largely notable for its modesty as an editorial in the new york times described him ford saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler and the record shows it he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career[39] appointed to the house appropriations committee two years after being elected he was a prominent member of the defense appropriations subcommittee ford described his philosophy as a moderate in domestic affairs an internationalist in foreign affairs and a conservative in fiscal policy[40]
in the early 1950s ford declined offers to run for either the senate or the michigan governorship rather his ambition was to become speaker of the house[41]
warren commission[edit] the warren commission presents its report to president johnson further information warren commission and assassination of john f kennedy on november 29 1963 president lyndon b johnson appointed ford to the warren commission a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of president john f kennedy[42] ford was assigned to prepare a biography of lee harvey oswald the accused assassin according to a 1963 fbi memo released in 2008 ford was in contact with the fbi throughout his time on the warren commission and relayed information to the deputy director cartha deloach about the panel's activities[43][44][45] in the preface to his book a presidential legacy and the warren commission ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions[46]
house minority leader[edit] ford meets with president richard nixon as house minority leader congressman gerald ford msfc director wernher von braun congressman george h mahon and nasa administrator james e webb visit the marshall space flight center for a briefing on the saturn program 1964 in 1964 democratic president lyndon johnson led a landslide victory for his party securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from republicans in the house of representatives following the election members of the republican caucus looked to select a new minority leader three members approached ford to see if he would be willing to serve after consulting with his family he agreed after a closely contested election ford was chosen to replace charles halleck of indiana as minority leader[47]
the republicans had 140 seats in the house compared with the 295 seats held by the democrats consequently the johnson administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by johnson the great society during the first session of the eighty-ninth congress alone the johnson administration submitted 87 bills to congress and johnson signed 84 or 96% arguably the most successful legislative agenda in congressional history[48]
criticism over the johnson administration's handling of the vietnam war began to grow in 1966 with ford and congressional republicans expressing concern that the united states was not doing what was necessary to win the war public sentiment also began to move against johnson and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing in favor of the republicans this was not enough to give republicans a majority in the house but the victory gave ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further great society programs[47]
ford's private criticism of the vietnam war became public following a speech from the floor of the house in which he questioned whether the white house had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion[47] the speech angered president johnson who accused ford of playing too much football without a helmet[47][49]
as minority leader in the house ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with illinois senator everett dirksen in which they proposed republican alternatives to johnson's policies many in the press jokingly called this the ev and jerry show[50] johnson said at the time jerry ford is so dumb he can't fart and chew gum at the same time[51] the press used to sanitizing lbj's salty language reported this as gerald ford can't walk and chew gum at the same time[52]
ford's role shifted under president nixon to being an advocate for the white house agenda congress passed several of nixon's proposals including the national environmental policy act and the tax reform act of 1969 another high-profile victory for the republican minority was the state and local fiscal assistance act passed in 1972 the act established a revenue sharing program for state and local governments[53] ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through congress and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against)[47][54]
during the 8 years (1965�1973) he served as minority leader ford won many friends in the house because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality[47] an office building in the us capitol complex house annex 2 was renamed for gerald ford as the ford house office building
vice presidency 1973�74[edit] gerald and betty ford with the president and first lady pat nixon after president nixon nominated ford to be vice president october 13 1973 on october 10 1973 vice president agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29500 in bribes while governor of maryland according to the new york times nixon sought advice from senior congressional leaders about a replacement the advice was unanimous 'we gave nixon no choice but ford' house speaker carl albert recalled later[39]
ford was nominated to take agnew's position on october 12 the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th amendment had been implemented the united states senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm ford on november 27 only three senators all democrats voted against ford's confirmation gaylord nelson of wisconsin thomas eagleton of missouri and william hathaway of maine on december 6 the house confirmed ford by a vote of 387 to 35 one hour after the confirmation vote in the house ford took the oath of office as vice president of the united states
following ford's appointment the watergate investigation continued until chief of staff alexander haig contacted ford on thursday august 1 1974 and told him that smoking gun evidence had been found the evidence left little doubt that president nixon had been a part of the watergate cover-up at the time ford and his wife betty were living in suburban virginia waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in washington dc however al haig [asked] to come over and see me ford later related to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a monday and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation and he said 'i'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared that things might change dramatically and you could become president' and i said 'betty i don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house'[9]

presidency 1974�77[edit] swearing-in[edit] gerald ford is sworn in as the 38th president of the united states by chief justice warren burger in the white house east room while betty ford looks on when nixon resigned on august 9 1974 ford assumed the presidency making him the only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office immediately after taking the oath of office in the east room of the white house he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation[55] ford noted the peculiarity of his position i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots and so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers[56] he went on to state
ford and his golden retriever liberty in the oval office 1974 i have not sought this enormous responsibility but i will not shirk it those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends they were of both parties elected by all the people and acting under the constitution in their name it is only fitting then that i should pledge to them and to you that i will be the president of all the people[57]
he also stated
my fellow americans our long national nightmare is over our constitution works our great republic is a government of laws and not of men here the people rule but there is a higher power by whatever name we honor him who ordains not only righteousness but love not only justice but mercy  let us restore the golden rule to our political process and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate[58]
message to congress nominating nelson a rockefeller to be vice president (august 20 1974) a portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to his presidential museum
on august 20 ford nominated former new york governor nelson rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated[59] rockefeller's top competitor had been george h w bush rockefeller underwent extended hearings before congress which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides such as henry kissinger although conservative republicans were not pleased that rockefeller was picked most of them voted for his confirmation and his nomination passed both the house and senate some including barry goldwater voted against him[60]
pardon of nixon[edit] president ford appears at a house judiciary subcommittee hearing regarding his pardon of richard nixon wikisource has original text related to this article the nixon pardon on september 8 1974 ford issued proclamation 4311 which gave nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the united states while president[61][62][63] in a televised broadcast to the nation ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the nixon family's situation is a tragedy in which we all have played a part it could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to it i have concluded that only i can do that and if i can i must[64]
the nixon pardon was highly controversial critics derided the move and claimed a corrupt bargain had been struck between the men[9] they claimed ford's pardon was granted in exchange for nixon's resignation that elevated ford to the presidency ford's first press secretary and close friend jerald terhorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon according to bob woodward nixon chief of staff alexander haig proposed a pardon deal to ford he later decided to pardon nixon for other reasons primarily the friendship he and nixon shared[65] regardless historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons ford lost the election in 1976 an observation with which ford agreed[65] in an editorial at the time the new york times stated that the nixon pardon was a profoundly unwise divisive and unjust act that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's credibility as a man of judgment candor and competence[39] on october 17 1974 ford testified before congress on the pardon he was the first sitting president to testify before congress since abraham lincoln[66]
after ford left the white house in 1977 the former president privately justified his pardon of nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of burdick v united states a 1915 us supreme court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt[67] in 2001 the john f kennedy library foundation awarded the john f kennedy profile in courage award to ford for his pardon of nixon[68] in presenting the award to ford senator ted kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon of nixon but later stated that history had proved ford to have made the correct decision[69]
pardon given by president ford under proclamation 4313 presidential proclamation 4313[edit] on september 16 shortly after he announced the nixon pardon ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for vietnam war draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as canada as well as for military deserters the conditions of the amnesty required that those involved reaffirm their allegiance to the united states and serve two years working in a public service job[70] full pardon for the draft dodgers however did not come about until the carter administration[71] the program for the return of vietnam era draft evaders and military deserters[72] established a clemency board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in military discharge status

midterm elections[edit] ford in the oval office 1974 main articles united states house elections 1974 and united states senate elections 1974 the 1974 congressional midterm elections took place fewer than three months after ford assumed office and in the wake of the watergate scandal the democratic party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the house elections taking 49 seats from the republican party and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats this was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority necessary to override a presidential veto (or to propose a constitutional amendment) perhaps due in part to this fact the 94th congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since andrew johnson was president of the united states (1865�1869)[76] even ford's old reliably republican seat was taken by democrat richard vander veen defeating republican robert vanderlaan in the senate elections the democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body[77]
domestic policy[edit] president ford meets with his cabinet in 1975 the economy was a great concern during the ford administration one of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create the economic policy board by executive order on september 30 1974[78] in response to rising inflation ford went before the american public in october 1974 and asked them to whip inflation now as part of this program he urged people to wear win buttons[79] at the time inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy more so than growing unemployment they felt as though controlling inflation would work to fix unemployment[78] to rein in inflation it was necessary to control the public's spending to try to mesh service and sacrifice win called for americans to reduce their spending and consumption[80] on october 4 1974 ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of congress and as a part of this speech kicked off the win campaign over the next nine days 101240 americans mailed in win pledges[78] in hindsight this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick without offering any means of solving the underlying problems[81] the main point of that speech was to introduce to congress a one-year five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals this plan would also take $44&#160billion out of the budget bringing federal spending below $300&#160billion[82] at the time inflation was over twelve percent[83]
ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic in the early 1970s an influenza strain h1n1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans on february 5 1976 an army recruit at fort dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized health officials announced that swine flu was the cause soon after public health officials in the ford administration urged that every person in the united states be vaccinated[84] although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in december of that year the vaccine was blamed for twenty-five deaths more people died from the shots than from the swine flu[85]
cheney rumsfeld and president ford in the oval office 1975 ford was an outspoken supporter of the equal rights amendment issuing presidential proclamation no 4383 in 1975
in this land of the free it is right and by nature it ought to be that all men and all women are equal before the law
now therefore i gerald r ford president of the united states of america to remind all americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the equal rights amendment adopted by the congress of the united states of america in order to secure legal equality for all women and men do hereby designate and proclaim august 26 1975 as women's equality day[86]
as president ford's position on abortion was that he supported a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 states to make the choice[87] this had also been his position as house minority leader in response to the 1973 supreme court case of roe v wade which he opposed[88] ford came under criticism for a 60 minutes interview his wife betty gave in 1975 in which she stated that roe v wade was a great great decision[89] during his later life ford would identify as pro-choice[90]
budget[edit] the federal budget ran a deficit every year ford was president[91] despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting ford signed the education for all handicapped children act of 1975 which established special education throughout the united states ford expressed strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children according to the official white house press release for the bill signing[92]
the economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the great depression four decades earlier[93] the focus of the ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment which reached nine percent in may 1975[94] in january 1975 ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16&#160billion to stimulate economic growth along with spending cuts to avoid inflation[82] ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction in congress the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $228&#160billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts[78] in march 1975 congress passed and ford signed into law these income tax rebates as part of the tax reduction act of 1975 this resulted in a federal deficit of around $53&#160billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $737&#160billion for 1976[95]
when new york city faced bankruptcy in 1975 mayor abraham beame was unsuccessful in obtaining ford's support for a federal bailout the incident prompted the new york daily news' famous headline ford to city drop dead referring to a speech in which ford declared flatly  that he would veto any bill calling for 'a federal bail-out of new york city'[96][97] the following month november 1975 ford changed his stance and asked congress to approve federal loans to new york city[98]
foreign policy[edit] ford meets with soviet leader leonid brezhnev during the vladivostok summit november 1974 to sign a joint communiqu� on the salt treaty ford makes remarks at a reciprocal dinner in beijing on december 4 1975 ford continued the d�tente policy with both the soviet union and china easing the tensions of the cold war still in place from the nixon administration was the strategic arms limitation treaty (salt)[99] the thawing relationship brought about by nixon's visit to china was reinforced by ford's december 1975 visit to the communist country[100] in 1975 the administration entered into the helsinki accords[101] with the soviet union creating the framework of the helsinki watch an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into human rights watch[102]
ford attended the inaugural meeting of the group of seven (g7) industrialized nations (initially the g5) in 1975 and secured membership for canada ford supported international solutions to issues we live in an interdependent world and therefore must work together to resolve common economic problems he said in a 1974 speech[103]
middle east[edit] countries visited by ford during his presidency in the middle east and eastern mediterranean two ongoing international disputes developed into crises the cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the turkish invasion of cyprus causing extreme strain within the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) alliance in mid-august the government withdrew greece from the nato military structure in mid-september 1974 the senate and house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to turkey ford concerned with both the effect of this on turkish-american relations and the deterioration of security on nato's eastern front vetoed the bill a second bill was passed by the house and vetoed although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year[3] as ford expected turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978
ford with anwar sadat in salzburg 1975 in the continuing arab-israeli conflict although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the yom kippur war kissinger's continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress ford considered it stalling and wrote their [israeli] tactics frustrated the egyptians and made me mad as hell[104] during kissinger's shuttle to israel in early march 1975 a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal prompted a cable from ford to prime minister yitzhak rabin which included
i wish to express my profound disappointment over israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations  failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations i have given instructions for a reassessment of united states policy in the region including our relations with israel with the aim of ensuring that overall american interests  are protected you will be notified of our decision[105]
on march 24 ford received congressional leaders of both parties and informed them of the reassessment of the administration policies in the middle east reassessment in practical terms meant to cancel or suspend further aid to israel for six months between march and september 1975 the united states refused to conclude any new arms agreements with israel rabin notes it was an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in american-israeli relations[106] as could be expected the announced reassessments upset the american jewish community and israel's well-wishers in congress on may 21 ford experienced a real shock seventy-six senators wrote him a letter urging him to be responsive to israel's request for $259&#160billion in military and economic aid ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized it was since the september 1974 ban on arms to turkey the second major congressional intrusion upon the president's [foreign policy] prerogatives[107] the following summer months were described by ford as an american-israeli war of nerves or test of wills[108] and after much bargaining the sinai interim agreement (sinai ii) was formally signed on september 1 and aid resumed
vietnam[edit] ford and his daughter susan watch as henry kissinger shakes hands with mao zedong december 2 1975 one of ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continued vietnam war american offensive operations against north vietnam had ended with the paris peace accords signed on january 27 1973 the accords declared a cease fire across both north and south vietnam and required the release of american prisoners of war the agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of vietnam and like the geneva conference of 1954 called for national elections in the north and south the paris peace accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of us forces[109]
the accords had been negotiated by united states national security advisor kissinger and north vietnamese politburo member le duc tho south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu was not involved in the final negotiations and publicly criticized the proposed agreement however anti-war pressures within the united states forced nixon and kissinger to pressure thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of american forces in multiple letters to the south vietnamese president nixon had promised that the united states would defend his government should the north vietnamese violate the accords[110]
in december 1974 months after ford took office north vietnamese forces invaded the province of phuoc long general trn vn tr� sought to gauge any south vietnamese or american response to the invasion as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion[111]
as north vietnamese forces advanced ford requested aid for south vietnam in a $522&#160million aid package the funds had been promised by the nixon administration but congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin[99] senator jacob javits offered large sums for evacuation but not one nickel for military aid[99] president thieu resigned on april 21 1975 publicly blaming the lack of support from the united states for the fall of his country[112] two days later on april 23 ford gave a speech at tulane university in that speech he announced that the vietnam war was over as far as america is concerned[110] the announcement was met with thunderous applause[110]
south vietnamese refugees arrive on a us navy vessel during operation frequent wind 1373 us citizens and 5595 vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the south vietnamese capital of saigon during operation frequent wind military and air america helicopters took evacuees to us navy ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on april 29 to 30 1975 immediately preceding the fall of saigon during the operation so many south vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people other helicopters having nowhere to land were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers close to the ships their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats[113]
many of the vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the united states under the indochina migration and refugee assistance act the 1975 act appropriated $455&#160million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of indochinese refugees[114] in all 130000 vietnamese refugees came to the united states in 1975 thousands more escaped in the years that followed[115]
mayaguez and panmunjom[edit] north vietnam's victory over the south led to a considerable shift in the political winds in asia and ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of us influence there the administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions once when khmer rouge forces seized an american ship in international waters and again when american military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (dmz) between north and south korea[116]
the first crisis was the mayaguez incident in may 1975 shortly after the fall of saigon and the khmer rouge conquest of cambodia cambodians seized the american merchant ship mayaguez in international waters[117] ford dispatched marines to rescue the crew but the marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as unknown to the us the mayaguez sailors were being released in the operation two military transport helicopters carrying the marines for the assault operation were shot down and 41 us servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 khmer rouge soldiers were killed[118] despite the american losses the operation was seen as a success in the united states and ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath[119] the americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial wall in washington dc
some historians have argued that the ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a soviet plot[120] but recent work by andrew gawthorpe based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions shows that ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local and perhaps even accidental provocation by an immature khmer government nevertheless they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other communist countries in asia[121]
the second crisis known as the axe murder incident occurred at panmunjom a village which stands in the dmz between the two koreas at the time this was the only part of the dmz where forces from the north and the south came into contact with each other encouraged by us difficulties in vietnam north korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the us to withdraw from south korea[122] then in august 1976 north korean forces killed two us officers and injured south korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in panmunjom's joint security area the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of non-aligned nations in colombo sri lanka at which kim jong-il the son of north korean leader kim il-sung presented the incident as an example of american aggression helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a us withdrawal from the south[123]
at administration meetings kissinger voiced the concern that the north would see the us as the paper tigers of saigon if they did not respond and ford agreed with that assessment after mulling various options the ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force a large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree while at the same time the air force was deployed which included b-52 bomber flights over panmunjom the north korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead and later issued an unprecedented official apology[124]
indonesian invasion of east timor[edit] east timor's decolonization due to political instability in portugal saw indonesia posture to annex the new state in 1975 just hours before the indonesian invasion of east timor (now timor leste) on december 7 1975 ford and kissinger had visited indonesian president suharto in jakarta and guaranteed american compliance with the indonesian operation suharto had been a key supporter of american influence in indonesia and southeast asia and ford did not desire to place pressure on the american-indonesian relationship[125]
under ford a policy of arms sales to the suharto regime began in 1975 before the invasion roughly 90% of the indonesian army's weapons at the time of east timor's invasion were provided by the us according to george h aldrich a former state department deputy legal advisor's hearing at the 1977 house international relations committee hearing post-invasion ford's military aid averaged about $30 million annually throughout east timor's occupation and arms sales increased exponentially under president carter this policy continued until 1999[126]
assassination attempts[edit] reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt main articles gerald ford assassination attempt in sacramento and sara jane moore ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency occurring within three weeks of each other and in the same state while in sacramento california on september 5 1975 lynette squeaky fromme a follower of charles manson pointed a colt 45-caliber handgun at ford[127] as fromme pulled the trigger larry buendorf[128] a secret service agent grabbed the gun and fromme was taken into custody she was later convicted of attempted assassination of the president and was sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on august 14 2009[129]
in reaction to this attempt the secret service began keeping ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later as he left the st francis hotel in downtown san francisco sara jane moore standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street pointed her 38-caliber revolver at him[130] moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off just before she fired a second round retired marine oliver sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of ford's head then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver who was slightly wounded moore was later sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on december 31 2007 having served 32 years[131]
judicial appointments[edit] further information gerald ford judicial appointment controversies supreme court[edit] main article gerald ford supreme court candidates john paul stevens was ford's only supreme court appointment in 1975 ford appointed john paul stevens as associate justice of the supreme court of the united states to replace retiring justice william o douglas stevens had been a judge of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit appointed by president nixon[132] during his tenure as house republican leader ford had led efforts to have douglas impeached[133] after being confirmed stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues[134] nevertheless president ford paid tribute to stevens he has served his nation well ford said of stevens with dignity intellect and without partisan political concerns[135]
other judicial appointments[edit] main article list of federal judges appointed by gerald ford in addition to the stevens appointment ford appointed 11 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 50 judges to the united states district courts[136]
1976 presidential election[edit] main article united states presidential election 1976 governor ronald reagan congratulates president ford after the president successfully wins the 1976 republican nomination while bob dole nancy reagan and nelson rockefeller look on ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976 but first he had to counter a challenge for the republican party nomination former governor of california ronald reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted ford for failing to do more in south vietnam for signing the helsinki accords and for negotiating to cede the panama canal (negotiations for the canal continued under president carter who eventually signed the torrijos-carter treaties) reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries including north carolina texas indiana and california before withdrawing from the race at the republican convention in kansas city missouri the conservative insurgency had already convinced ford to drop the more liberal vice president nelson rockefeller in favor of us senator bob dole of kansas[137]
in addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-republican sentiment ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery chevy chase often did pratfalls on saturday night live imitating ford who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term as chase commented he even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree[138]
president ford's 1976 election campaign had the advantage that he was an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the united states bicentennial the washington dc fireworks display on the fourth of july was presided over by the president and televised nationally[139] on july 7 1976 the president and first lady served as hosts at a white house state dinner for queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of the united kingdom which was televised on the public broadcasting service network the 200th anniversary of the battles of lexington and concord in massachusetts gave ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110000 in concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for reconciliation not recrimination and reconstruction not rancor between the united states and those who would pose threats to peace[140] speaking in new hampshire on the previous day ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to basic american virtues[141]
ford (at right) and jimmy carter in a debate on september 23 1976 democratic nominee and former georgia governor jimmy carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer gaining support from voters dismayed by the watergate scandal and nixon pardon after the democratic national convention he held a huge 33-point lead over ford in the polls however as the campaign continued the race tightened and by election day the polls showed the race as too close to call there were three main events in the fall campaign most importantly carter repeated a promise of a blanket pardon for christian and other religious refugees and also all vietnam war draft dodgers (ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates an act which froze ford's poll numbers in ohio wisconsin hawaii and mississippi (ford had needed to shift just 11000 votes in ohio plus one of the other three in order to win) it was the first act signed by carter on january 20 1977 earlier playboy magazine had published a controversial interview with carter in the interview carter admitted to having lusted in my heart for women other than his wife which cut into his support among women and evangelical christians also on september 24 ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since 1960 polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that ford was the winner carter was also hurt by ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader and that carter was vague on many issues
ford campaigns at the nassau county veterans coliseum in hempstead new york on october 31 1976 during the final days of his failed election campaign televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election as such ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates saying they gave the viewers reason to think that jimmy carter had something to offer the turning point came in the second debate when ford blundered by stating there is no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a ford administration ford also said that he did not believe that the poles consider themselves dominated by the soviet union[142] in an interview years later ford said he had intended to imply that the soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern europeans seeking independence however the phrasing was so awkward that questioner max frankel was visibly incredulous at the response[143] as a result of this blunder and carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the vietnam era during the presidential debates ford's surge stalled and carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls
in the end carter won the election receiving 501% of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 480% and 240 electoral votes for ford the election was close enough that had fewer than 25000 votes shifted in ohio and wisconsin � both of which neighbored his home state � ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for carter[144] though he lost in the three months between the republican national convention and the election ford managed to close what was once an alleged 33-point carter lead to a 2-point margin despite his defeat ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by carter
had ford won the election the provisions of the 22nd amendment would have disqualified him from running in 1980 because he had served more than two years of nixon's remaining term
post-presidential years 1977�2006[edit] activity[edit] the nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided ford's successor jimmy carter opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing president saying for myself and for our nation i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land[145]

during the term of office of his successor jimmy carter ford received monthly briefs by president carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues and was always invited to lunch at the white house whenever he was in washington dc their close friendship developed after carter had left office with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of anwar el-sadat in 1981[149] until ford's death carter and his wife rosalynn visited the fords' home frequently[150] ford and carter served as honorary co-chairs of the national commission on federal election reform in 2001 and of the continuity of government commission in 2002

ford considered a run for the republican nomination in 1980 foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with carter ford attacked carter's conduct of the salt ii negotiations and foreign policy in the middle east and africa many have argued that ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an accidental president and to win a term in his own right ford also believed the more conservative ronald reagan would be unable to defeat carter and would hand the incumbent a second term ford was encouraged by his former secretary of state henry kissinger as well as jim rhodes of ohio and bill clements of texas to make the race on march 15 1980 ford announced that he would forgo a run for the republican nomination vowing to support the eventual nominee
after securing the republican nomination in 1980 ronald reagan considered his former rival ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate but negotiations between the reagan and ford camps at the republican national convention were unsuccessful ford conditioned his acceptance on reagan's agreement to an unprecedented co-presidency[151] giving ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as kissinger as secretary of state and alan greenspan as treasury secretary) after rejecting these terms reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to george hw bush[152] ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the reagan-bush ticket in which he declared that the country would be better served by a reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of jimmy carter[153]

death and legacy[edit] ford's casket lies in state at the united states capitol as his widow betty kneels in prayer main article death and state funeral of gerald ford ford died on december 26 2006 at his home in rancho mirage california of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis his age at the time of his death was 93 years and 165 days making ford the longest-lived us president[177] on december 30 2006 ford became the 11th us president to lie in state the burial was preceded by a state funeral and memorial services held at the national cathedral in washington dc on january 2 2007 after the service ford was interred at his presidential museum in grand rapids michigan[178]

the state of michigan commissioned and submitted a statue of ford to the national statuary hall collection replacing zachariah chandler it was unveiled on may 3 2011 in the capitol rotunda on the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by thomas p tip o'neill speaker of the house at the end of ford�s presidency god has been good to america especially during difficult times at the time of the civil war he gave us abraham lincoln and at the time of watergate he gave us gerald ford�the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again on the proper left side are words from ford's swearing-in address our constitution works our great republic is a government of laws and not of men here the people rule
longevity[edit] ford was the longest-lived us president his lifespan being 45 days longer than ronald reagan's he was the third-longest-lived vice president falling short only of john nance garner 98 and levi p morton 96 ford also had the third-longest post-presidency (29 years and 11 months) after jimmy carter (34 years&#1609 months and counting) and herbert hoover (31 years and 7 months)
on november 12 2006 upon surpassing ronald reagan's lifespan ford released his last public statement
the length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends i thank god for the gift of every sunrise and even more for all the years he has blessed me with betty and the children with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime that includes countless americans who in recent months have remembered me in their prayers your kindness touches me deeply may god bless you all and may god bless america[181]
public image[edit] president george w bush with ford and his wife betty on april 23 2006 this is the last known public photo of gerald ford ford was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice-president the choice of ford to fulfill agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on his reputation for openness and honesty[182] in all the years i sat in the house i never knew mr ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false he never attempted to shade a statement and i never heard him utter an unkind word said martha griffiths[183]
the trust the american people had in him was severely and rapidly tarnished by his pardon of nixon[183] nonetheless many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought[183] his subsequent loss to carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation[182]
in spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy likable and simple-minded everyman an incident in 1975 when he tripped while exiting the presidential jet in austria was famously and repetitively parodied by chevy chase cementing ford's image as a klutz[183][184][185] pieces of ford's common everyman image have also been attributed to ford's inevitable comparison to nixon as well as his perceived midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation[182] ridicule often extended to supposed intellectual limitations with lyndon b johnson once joking he's a nice fellow but he spent too much time playing football without a helmet[183]
