bush began his formal education at the greenwich country day school in greenwich beginning in 1936 he attended phillips academy in andover massachusetts where he held a number of leadership positions including president of the senior class secretary of the student council president of the community fund-raising group a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams[4]
world war ii following the attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 bush decided to join the us navy[1] so after graduating from phillips academy in 1942 he became a naval aviator at the age of 18[4] after completing the 10-month course he was commissioned as an ensign in the united states naval reserve at naval air station corpus christi on june 9 1943 just three days before his 19th birthday which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date[1]
he was assigned to torpedo squadron (vt-51) as the photographic officer in september 1943[1] the following year his squadron was based on the uss&#160san jacinto as a member of air group 51 where his lanky physique earned him the nickname skin[5] during this time the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of world war ii the battle of the philippine sea[1]
after bush's promotion to lieutenant (junior grade) on august 1 1944 the san jacinto commenced operations against the japanese in the bonin islands bush piloted one of four grumman tbm avenger aircraft from vt-51 that attacked the japanese installations on chichijima[6] his crew for the mission which occurred on september 2 1944 included radioman second class john delaney and lieutenant junior grade william white[1] during their attack the avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire bush's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught on fire despite his plane being on fire bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target scoring several damaging hits[1] with his engine ablaze bush flew several miles from the island where he and one other crew member on the tbm avenger bailed out of the aircraft[7] the other man's parachute did not open[1] bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine uss&#160finback[1] for the next month he remained on the finback and participated in the rescue of other pilots several of those shot down during the attack were executed and eaten by their captors[8]
george bush in his tbm avenger on the carrier uss&#160san jacinto in 1944 bush subsequently returned to san jacinto in november 1944 and participated in operations in the philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the united states through 1944 he flew 58 combat missions[7] for which he received the distinguished flying cross three air medals and the presidential unit citation awarded to san jacinto[1]
because of his valuable combat experience bush was reassigned to norfolk navy base and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots he was later assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron vt-153 based at naval air station grosse ile michigan upon the japanese surrender in 1945 bush was honorably discharged in september of that year
marriage and college years george bush married barbara pierce on january 6 1945 only weeks after his return from the pacific the couple's first residence was a small rented apartment in trenton michigan near bush's navy assignment at nas grosse ile their marriage produced six children george walker bush (born 1946) pauline robinson robin bush (1949�1953 died of leukemia) john ellis jeb bush (born 1953) neil mallon bush (born 1955) marvin pierce bush (born 1956) and dorothy bush koch (born 1959)[9]
bush had been accepted to yale university prior to his enlistment in the military and took up the offer after his discharge and marriage[10] while at yale he was enrolled in an accelerated program that allowed him to graduate in two and a half years rather than four[10] he was a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity and was elected its president[11] he also captained the yale baseball team and as a left-handed first baseman played in the first two college world series[10] as the team captain bush met babe ruth before a game during his senior year he was also like his father a member of the yale cheerleading squad[12] late in his junior year he was like his father prescott bush (1917) initiated into the skull and bones secret society he graduated as a member of the phi beta kappa from yale in 1948 with a bachelor of arts degree in economics[13]
business career after graduating from yale bush moved his young family to west texas his father's business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business starting as a sales clerk with dresser industries a subsidiary of brown brothers harriman (where prescott bush had served on the board of directors for 22 years)[14] while working for dresser bush lived in various places with his family odessa texas ventura bakersfield and compton california and midland texas[15] (according to eldest son george w bush then age two the family lived in one of the few duplexes in odessa with an indoor bathroom which they shared with a couple of hookers)[16] bush started the bush-overbey oil development company in 1951 and in 1953 co-founded the zapata petroleum corporation an oil company that drilled in the permian basin in texas[17] in 1954 he was named president of the zapata offshore company a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling
in 1959 shortly after the subsidiary became independent bush moved the company and his family from midland to houston[18] he continued serving as president of the company until 1964 and later chairman until 1966 but his ambitions turned political[14] by that time bush had become a millionaire[19]
political career 1964�80 congressional years 1967�71 bush served as chairman of the republican party for harris county texas in 1964 but wanted to be more involved in policy making so he set his sights high he aimed for a us senate seat from texas[14] after winning the republican primary bush faced his opponent incumbent democrat ralph w yarborough who attacked bush as a right-wing extremist and bush lost the general election the republican candidate for governor jack crichton of dallas a louisiana native who often campaigned alongside bush before the election lost by a much wider margin to governor john b connally jr[20] it was suggested in pbs's american experience episode about bush that he and the harris county republicans played a role in the development of the new republican party of the late 20th century first bush worked to absorb the john birch society members who were trying to take over the republican party and lead it towards a more anti-communist direction second during and after the civil rights movement democrats in the south who were committed to segregation left their party and although the country club republicans had differing ideological beliefs they found common ground in hoping to expel the democrats from power[21]
bush with president dwight d eisenhower bush was elected in 1966 to a house of representatives seat from the 7th district of texas defeating with 57 percent of the ballots cast the democrat frank briscoe the district attorney of harris county known for his law and order credentials and a cousin of later governor dolph briscoe[22][23] bush was the first republican to represent houston in the us house[14] bush's representative district included tanglewood the houston neighborhood that was his residence[24] his family had moved into tanglewood in the 1960s[25] his voting record in the house was generally conservative bush voted for the civil rights act of 1968 although it was generally unpopular in his district he supported the nixon administration's vietnam policies but broke with republicans on the issue of birth control which he supported[14] despite being a first-term congressman bush was appointed to the powerful house ways and means committee where he voted to abolish the military draft[19] he was elected to a second term in 1968[26]
in 1970 nixon convinced bush to relinquish his house seat to run for the senate against ralph yarborough a fierce nixon critic in the republican primary bush easily defeated conservative robert j morris by a margin of 876% to 124%[27] nixon came to texas to campaign in longview for bush and gubernatorial candidate paul eggers a dallas lawyer who was a close friend of us senator john g tower[28] former congressman lloyd bentsen a more moderate democrat and native of mission in south texas defeated yarborough in the democratic primary[19] yarborough endorsed bentsen who defeated bush 534 to 466%[29] as bush's political career waned he moved out of houston and sold his first tanglewood house but for periods of time continued to reside in tanglewood[25]
ambassador to the united nations (1971�73) bush as ambassador to the united nations 1971 following his 1970 loss bush was well known as a prominent republican businessman from the sun belt a group of states in the southern part of the country[19] nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice bush had made of his congressional position[14] so he appointed him ambassador to the united nations[13] he was confirmed unanimously by the senate and served for two years beginning in 1971[14]
chairman of the republican national committee (1973�74) amidst the watergate scandal nixon asked bush to become chairman of the republican national committee in 1973[13] bush accepted and held this position when the popularity of both nixon and the republican party plummeted[30] he defended nixon steadfastly but later as nixon's complicity became clear bush focused more on defending the republican party while still maintaining loyalty to nixon as chairman bush formally requested that nixon eventually resign for the good of the republican party[14] nixon did this on august 9 1974 bush noted in his diary that there was an aura of sadness like somebody died the [resignation] speech was vintage nixon�a kick or two at the press�enormous strains one couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame [president gerald ford's swearing-in offered] indeed a new spirit a new lift[31]
envoy to china 1974�75 bush as united states liaison to china circa 1975 gerald ford nixon's successor appointed bush to be chief of the us liaison office in the people's republic of china since the united states at the time maintained official relations with the republic of china on taiwan and not the people's republic of china the liaison office did not have the official status of an embassy and bush did not formally hold the position of ambassador though he unofficially acted as one the 14 months that he spent in china were largely seen as beneficial for us-china relations[14]
after ford's accession to the presidency bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president ford eventually narrowed his list to nelson rockefeller and bush white house chief of staff donald rumsfeld reportedly preferred rockefeller over bush rockefeller was finally named and confirmed[32]
bush was again passed over for the vice presidency by ford when the president chose bush's future presidential rival senator bob dole to replace rockefeller on the 1976 presidential ticket
director of central intelligence (1976�77) bush as cia director listens at a meeting following the assassinations in beirut of francis e meloy jr and robert o waring 1976 in 1976 ford brought bush back to washington to become director of central intelligence (dci) replacing william colby[33] he served in this role for 357 days from january 30 1976 to january 20 1977[34] the cia had been rocked by a series of revelations including those based on investigations by the church committee regarding illegal and unauthorized activities by the cia and bush was credited with helping to restore the agency's morale[35] in his capacity as dci bush gave national security briefings to jimmy carter both as a presidential candidate and as president-elect and discussed the possibility of remaining in that position in a carter administration[36] but did not do so he was succeeded by deputy director of central intelligence e henry knoche who served as acting director of central intelligence until stansfield turner was confirmed[37]
other positions 1977�80 after a democratic administration took power in 1977 bush became chairman on the executive committee of the first international bank in houston[38] he later spent a year as a part-time professor of administrative science at rice university's jones school of business beginning in 1978 the year it opened bush said of his time there i loved my brief time in the world of academia[39] between 1977 and 1979 he was a director of the council on foreign relations foreign policy organization[40]
1980 presidential campaign see also united states presidential election 1980 bush (far right) in the nashua debate with reagan (far left) and the moderator bush had decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980 in 1979 he attended 850 political events and traveled more than 250000 miles (400000&#160km) to campaign for the nation's highest office in the contest for the republican party nomination bush stressed his wide range of government experience while competing against rivals senator howard baker of tennessee senator bob dole of kansas congressman john anderson of illinois (who would later run as an independent) congressman phil crane also of illinois former governor john connally of texas and the front-runner ronald reagan former actor and governor of california[32]
in the primary election bush focused almost entirely on the iowa caucuses while reagan ran a more traditional campaign bush represented the centrist wing in the gop whereas reagan represented conservatives bush famously labeled reagan's supply side-influenced plans for massive tax cuts voodoo economics his strategy proved useful to some degree as he won in iowa with 315% to reagan's 294% after the win bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum or big mo as a result of the loss reagan replaced his campaign manager reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary the two men agreed to a debate in the state organized by the nashua telegraph but paid for by the reagan campaign reagan invited the other four candidates as well but bush refused to debate them and eventually they left the debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign when the moderator john breen ordered reagan's microphone turned off his angry response i am paying for this microphone struck a chord with the public bush ended up losing new hampshire's primary with 23% to reagan's 50% bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well and formally dropped out of the race in may of that year[32]
with his political future seeming dismal bush sold his house in houston and bought his grandfather's estate in kennebunkport maine known as walker's point[41] at the republican convention reagan selected bush as his vice presidential nominee placing him on the winning republican presidential ticket of 1980
vice presidency (1981�89) see also presidency of ronald reagan vice presidential portrait first term 1981�85 as vice president bush generally took on a low profile while recognizing the constitutional limits of the office he avoided decision-making or criticizing reagan in any way as had become customary he and his wife moved into the vice president's residence at number one observatory circle about two miles from the white house after selling the house in the tanglewood the bushes declared a room in the houstonian hotel in houston as their official voting address[24] the bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions including many state funerals which became a common joke for comedians mrs bush found the funerals largely beneficial saying george met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to president reagan as the president of the senate bush stayed in contact with members of congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on capitol hill[32]
bush with president ronald reagan on march 30 1981 early into the administration reagan was shot and seriously wounded in washington dc bush second in command by the presidential line of succession was in fort worth texas and flew back to washington immediately reagan's cabinet convened in the white house situation room where they discussed various issues including the availability of the nuclear football when bush's plane landed his aides advised him to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack bush rejected the idea responding only the president lands on the south lawn[32] this made a positive impression on reagan[32] who recovered and returned to work within two weeks from then on the two men would have regular thursday lunches in the oval office
in december 1983 bush flew to el salvador and warned that country's military leaders to end their death squads and hold fully free elections or face the loss of us aid bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of �lvaro maga�a bush was never told of the aides' concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of maga�a's personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside[42]
bush was assigned by reagan to chair two special task forces on deregulation and international drug smuggling the deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise in order to curb the size of the federal government the drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the united states both were popular issues with conservatives and bush largely a moderate began courting them through his work[32]
second term 1985�89 reagan and bush ran for reelection in 1984 the democratic opponent walter mondale made history by choosing a woman as his running mate new york representative geraldine ferraro she and bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate[43] serving as a contrast to the ivy-league educated bush ferraro represented a blue-collar district in queens new york this coupled with her popularity among female journalists left bush at a disadvantage the reagan-bush ticket won in a landslide against the mondale-ferraro ticket early into his second term as vice president bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988 by the end of 1985 a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for bush[32]
bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when on july 13 1985 reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon making bush acting president for approximately eight hours
the reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in 1986 when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to iran and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunist contras in nicaragua a direct violation of the law when the iran-contra affair as it became known broke to the media bush like reagan stated that he had been out of the loop and unaware of the diversion of funds[44] although this was later questioned[45] his diaries from that time stated i'm one of the few people that know fully the details[46] ailes and others were concerned that bush was seen as a wimp an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview with dan rather[32]
as vice president bush officially opened the 1987 pan american games in indianapolis
in 1988 the us accidentally shot down iran air flight 655 killing 290 passengers bush said that he would never apologize for the united states of america ever i don�t care what the facts are[47]
1988 presidential campaign main article united states presidential election 1988 vice president bush campaigns in st louis missouri with john ashcroft 1988 in the january 26 1987 issue of time magazine in an article entitled where is the real george bush journalist robert ajemian reported that a friend of bush's had urged him to spend several days at camp david thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency to which bush is said to have responded in exasperation oh the vision thing[48] this oft-cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner the phrase has since become a metonym for any politician's failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures[49]
bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as 1985 and entered the republican primary for president of the united states in october 1987[32] his challengers for the republican presidential nomination included us senator bob dole of kansas us representative jack kemp of new york former governor pete dupont of delaware and conservative christian televangelist pat robertson
though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination bush came in third in the iowa caucus behind winner dole and runner-up robertson[50] much like reagan did in 1980 bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary[32] with dole ahead in new hampshire bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser[51] he rebounded to win the state's primary following the primary bush and dole had a joint media appearance when the interviewer asked dole if he had anything to say to bush dole said in response to the ads yeah stop lying about my record in an angry tone this is thought to have hurt dole's campaign to bush's benefit bush continued seeing victory winning many southern primaries as well[14] once the multiple-state primaries such as super tuesday began bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match and the nomination was his[19]
leading up to the 1988 republican national convention there was much speculation as to bush's choice of running mate bush chose little-known us senator dan quayle of indiana favored by conservatives despite reagan's popularity bush trailed democratic nominee michael dukakis then governor of massachusetts in most polls[52]
bush occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to reagan delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 republican national convention known as the thousand points of light speech it described bush's vision of america he endorsed the pledge of allegiance prayer in schools capital punishment gun rights and opposed abortion[52] the speech at the convention included bush's famous pledge read my lips no new taxes[53]
the 1988 presidential electoral votes by state the general election campaign between the two men has been described as one of the nastiest in modern times[53] bush blamed dukakis for polluting the boston harbor as the massachusetts governor[14] bush also pointed out that dukakis was opposed to the law that would require all students to say the pledge of allegiance a topic well covered in bush's nomination acceptance speech[52]
dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates moderator bernard shaw asked dukakis if dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife kitty were raped and murdered[54] dukakis's response of no as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon willie horton contributed toward bush's characterization of dukakis as soft on crime[14]
bush defeated dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen in the electoral college by 426 to 111 (bentsen received one vote from a faithless elector)[53] in the nationwide popular vote bush took 534% of the ballots cast while dukakis received 456%[14] bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since martin van buren in 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since herbert hoover in 1929[32]
presidency (1989�93) chief justice william rehnquist administering the oath of office to president bush during inaugural ceremonies at the united states capitol january 20 1989 bush was inaugurated on january 20 1989 succeeding ronald reagan he entered office at a period of change in the world the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of soviet union came early in his presidency[2] he ordered military operations in panama and the persian gulf and at one point was recorded as having a record-high approval rating of 89%[55] economic recession and breaking his no new taxes pledge caused a sharp decline in his approval rating and bush lost the 1992 election[2]
in his inaugural address bush said
i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise we live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better for a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in man's heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over the totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree a new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on there is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken[56]

the agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly democrats who charged that nafta resulted in a loss of american jobs[19] nafta also contained no provisions for labor rights according to the bush administration the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the nafta trade talks such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to congress for a vote thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that congress wished to change[95] while initial signing was possible during his term negotiations made slow but steady progress president clinton would go on to make the passage of nafta a priority for his administration despite its conservative and republican roots�with the addition of two side agreements�to achieve its passage in 1993[96]
the treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further the american economy has grown 54% since the adoption of nafta in 1993 with 25&#160million new jobs created this was seen by some as evidence of nafta being beneficial to the united states[97] with talk in early 2008 regarding a possible american withdrawal from the treaty carlos m gutierrez current united states secretary of commerce writes quitting nafta would send economic shock waves throughout the world and the damage would start here at home[97] but john j sweeney president of the afl-cio wrote in the boston globe that the us trade deficit with canada and mexico ballooned to 12 times its pre-nafta size reaching $111&#160billion in 2004[98]

conservative political columnist pat buchanan challenged bush for the republican nomination and shocked political pundits by finishing second with 37% of the vote in the new hampshire primary bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues in an attempt to undermine buchanan's base[19] once he had secured the nomination bush faced his challenger democrat and governor of arkansas william jefferson bill clinton clinton attacked bush as not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being out of touch with the common man a notion reinforced by reporter andrew rosenthal's false report that bush was astonished to see a demonstration of a supermarket scanner[107]

his ability to gain broad international support for the gulf war and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph[130] rousing bipartisan approval[131] though his decision to withdraw without removing saddam hussein left mixed feelings and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy[132] a new york times article mistakenly depicted bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was out of touch amid the early 1990s recession his image shifted from conquering hero to politician befuddled by economic matters[107]
