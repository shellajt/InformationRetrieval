humanitarian religion quaker signature herbert clark hoover (august 10 1874 � october 20 1964) was the 31st president of the united states (1929�1933) he was a professional mining engineer and was raised as a quaker a republican hoover served as head of the us food administration during world war i and became internationally known for humanitarian relief efforts in war-time belgium[1] as the united states secretary of commerce in the 1920s under presidents warren g harding and calvin coolidge he promoted partnerships between government and business under the rubric economic modernization in the presidential election of 1928 hoover easily won the republican nomination despite having no elected-office experience hoover is the most recent cabinet secretary to be elected president of the united states as well as one of only two presidents (along with william howard taft) elected without electoral experience or high military rank
hoover a globally experienced engineer believed strongly in the efficiency movement which held that the government and the economy were riddled with inefficiency and waste and could be improved by experts who could identify the problems and solve them he also believed in the importance of volunteerism and of the role of individuals in society and the economy hoover who had made a small fortune in mining was the first of two presidents to redistribute his salary (president kennedy was the other he donated all his paychecks to charity)[2] when the wall street crash of 1929 struck less than eight months after he took office hoover tried to combat the ensuing great depression with moderate government public works projects such as the hoover dam the record tariffs imbedded in the smoot-hawley tariff and aggressive increases in the top tax bracket from 25% to 63% coupled with increases in corporate taxes[3] yielded a balanced budget in 1933 but the economy plummeted simultaneously and unemployment rates rose to afflict one in four american workers this downward spiral set the stage for hoover's defeat in 1932 by democrat franklin d roosevelt who promised a new deal after roosevelt assumed the presidency in 1933 hoover became a spokesman for opposition to the domestic and foreign policies of the new deal in 1947 president harry s truman appointed hoover to head the hoover commission intended to foster greater efficiency throughout the federal bureaucracy most historians agree that hoover's defeat in the 1932 election was caused primarily by the downward economic spiral although his strong support for prohibition was also significant hoover is usually ranked lower than average among us presidents

family background and early life[edit] 1877 herbert hoover tintype herbert hoover was born on august 10 1874 in west branch iowa the first of his office born in that state and west of the mississippi river his father jesse hoover (1849�1880) was a blacksmith and farm implement store owner of german (pfautz wehmeyer) and swiss (huber burkhart) ancestry jesse hoover and his father eli had moved to iowa from ohio twenty years previously[4] hoover's mother hulda randall minthorn (1849�1884) was born in norwich ontario canada and was of english and irish ancestry both of his parents were quakers
at about age two bertie as he was then called contracted the croup he was so ill that he was momentarily thought to have died until he was resuscitated by his uncle john minthorn[5] as a child he was often called by his father my little stick in the mud since he repeatedly was trapped in the mud while crossing an unpaved street[6] hoover's family figured prominently in the town's public prayer life due almost entirely to hulda's role in her church[7] his father noted by the local paper for his pleasant sunshiny disposition died in 1880 after working to retire her husband's debts retain their life insurance and care for the children his mother died in 1884 leaving hoover (age nine) his older brother and his younger sister as orphans[8] fellow quaker lawrie tatum was appointed as hoover's guardian
herbert hoover birthplace cottage west branch iowa after a brief stay with one of his grandmothers in kingsley iowa hoover lived the next 18 months with his uncle allen hoover in west branch in november 1885 he went to newberg oregon to live with his uncle dr john minthorn a physician and businessman whose own son had died the year before the minthorn household was considered cultured and educational and imparted a strong work ethic[9] for two-and-a-half years hoover attended friends pacific academy (now george fox university) and then worked as an office assistant in his uncle's real estate office the oregon land company in salem oregon though he did not attend high school hoover attended night school and learned bookkeeping typing and mathematics[10]
hoover entered stanford university in 1891 its inaugural year after failing all the entrance exams (except mathematics) and then being tutored for the summer in palo alto[11] the first-year students were not required to pay tuition[10] hoover claimed to be the very first student at stanford by virtue of having been the first person in the first class to sleep in the dormitory[12] while at the university he was the student manager of both the baseball and football teams and was a part of the inaugural big game versus rival the university of california and friend (cal manager) herbert lang[13] only 10000 tickets were printed for the inaugural game and 20000 people showed up both hoover and lang had to find pots bowls and any other available receptacles to collect admission fees[14] stanford won the game[12] hoover graduated in 1895 with a degree in geology[15] he earned his way through four years of college working various jobs on and off campus including at the arkansas and united states geological survey[16] throughout his tenure at stanford he was adamantly opposed to the fraternity system[17]
mining engineer[edit] australia[edit] hoover went to western australia in 1897 as an employee of bewick moreing & co a london-based gold mining company his geological training and work experience were well suited for the firm's objectives[18] he worked at gold mines in big bell cue gwalia menzies and coolgardie[19][20] hoover first went to coolgardie then the center of the western australian goldfields where he worked under edward hooper a company partner conditions were harsh in these goldfields even though he got a $5000 salary (equivalent to $100000 today)[21] in the coolgardie and murchison rangelands on the edge of the great victoria desert hoover described the region as a land of black flies red dust and white heat[22] he served as a geologist and mining engineer while searching the western australian goldfields for investments after being appointed as mine manager at the age of 23 he led a major program of expansion for the sons of gwalia gold mine at gwalia and brought in many italian immigrants to cut costs and counter the union militancy of the australian miners[23][24] he believed the rivalry between the italians and the other men was of no small benefit[23] he also described italians as fully 20 per cent superior[23] to other miners
during his time at gwalia hoover first met fleury james lyster a pioneering metallurgist[25][26] in western australia friends called hoover hc or the old nickname hail columbia[27] an open feud developed between hoover and his boss ernest williams with hoover persuading four other mine managers to conspire against his rival the firm's principals then offered hoover a compelling promotion which would relocate him to china and also end the feud[28] hoover then began to take stock of his private life including contemplating a separation from his stanford sweetheart lou henry
china and other global operations[edit] herbert hoover aged 23 taken in perth western australia in 1898 hoover promptly sent a cable of proposal to her and subsequently married lou henry in 1899 she had been an episcopalian and became a quaker the hoovers had two sons herbert charles hoover (1903�1969) and allan henry hoover (1907�1993) the family subsequently went to china hoover worked as chief engineer for the chinese bureau of mines and as general manager for the chinese engineering and mining corporation[29] later he worked for bewick moreing & co as the company's lead engineer hoover and his wife learned mandarin chinese while he worked in china and used it during his tenure at the white house when they wanted to foil eavesdroppers[30] hoover made recommendations to improve the lot of the chinese worker seeking to end the practice of imposing long term servitude contracts and to institute reforms for workers based on merit[31] the boxer rebellion trapped the hoovers in tianjin in june 1900 for almost a month the settlement was under fire and both dedicated themselves to defense of their city hoover himself guided us marines around tianjin during the battle using his knowledge of the local terrain[32] mrs hoover meanwhile devoted her efforts at the various hospitals and even wielded and willingly and accurately deployed a 38-caliber pistol[33]
hoover was made a partner in bewick moreing & co on december 18 1901 and assumed responsibility for various australian operations and investments[34] his initial compensation rose to $12500 annually in addition to a 20% share of profits[35] the company eventually controlled at one point approximately 50% of gold production in western australia[36] in 1901 hoover no longer lived in australia but he visited the country in 1902 1903 1905 and 1907 as an overseas investor
lou henry age 17 on a burro and rifle-ready at acton california on august 22 1891 hoover was also a director of chinese engineering and mining corporation (cemc) when it became a supplier of immigrant labor from southeast asia for south african mines[37] the first shipment of almost 2000 workers arrived in durban from qinhuangdao in july 1904 by 1906 the total number of immigrant workers increased to 50000 almost entirely recruited and shipped by cemc when the living and working conditions of the laborers became known public opposition to the scheme grew and questions were asked in the british parliament[38] the scheme was abandoned in 1911
in august�september 1905 he founded the zinc corporation (eventually part of the rio tinto group) with william baillieu and others the lead-silver ore produced at broken hill new south wales was rich in zinc but the zinc could not be recovered due to the sulphide problem and was left in the tailings that remained after the silver and lead was extracted[39]
zinc corporation proposed to buy the tailings and extract the zinc by a new process the froth flotation process was then being developed at broken hill although the zinc corporation struggled to apply it[40] hoover came to broken hill in 1907 so did australian engineer jim lyster whose lyster process[25] enabled the zinc corporation to operate the world's first selective or differential flotation plant from september 1912[41] hoover's brother theodore j hoover also came to broken hill
broken hill was one of the dreariest places in the world at this time it lay in the middle of the desert was unbelievably hot in summer had no fresh water no vegetation and mountains of tailings blew into every crack with every wisp of wind[42] despite these miserable conditions hoover and his associates became suppliers to world industry of zinc and other vital base minerals
sole proprietor[edit] herbert hoover in his 30s while a mining engineer in 1908 hoover became an independent mining consultant traveling worldwide until the outbreak of world war i in 1914 he left bewick moreing & co and setting out on his own eventually ended up with investments on every continent and offices in san francisco london new york city st petersburg paris and mandalay burma[43] he had his second successful venture with the british firm burma corporation again producing silver lead and zinc in large quantities at the namtu bawdwin mine where he caught malaria in 1907[44] while living in london noting the american engineer's patriotic intensity some british acquaintances referred to him as the star-spangled hoover it recalled the nickname he had acquired in the australian outback hail columbia hoover[45] the bawdwin mine ultimately became the chief source of hoover's fortune[46]
in his spare time hoover wrote his lectures at columbia and stanford universities were published in 1909 as principles of mining[47] which became a standard textbook hoover and his wife also published their english translation of the 1556 mining classic de re metallica in 1912 this translation from the latin of renaissance author georgius agricola is still the most important scholarly version and provides its historical context[48] it is still in print
by 1914 hoover was a wealthy man with an estimated personal fortune of $4 million[49] he was once quoted as saying if a man has not made a million dollars by the time he is forty he is not worth much[50] by 1914 hoover stood eventually to obtain what he later described as a large fortune from these russian industries probably more than is good for anybody[51] sixty-six years after opening the mine in 1897 hoover still had a partial share in the sons of gwalia mine when it finally closed in 1963 just one year before the former president's death in new york city in 1964 the successful mine had yielded $55m in gold and $10m in dividends for investors[52] herbert hoover acting as a main investor financier mining speculator and organizer of men played a major role in the important metallurgical developments that occurred in broken hill in the first decade of the twentieth century developments that had a great impact on the mining and production of silver lead and zinc[53][54][55][56][57][58] in later years hoover thought of himself and his associates as engineering doctors to sick concerns hence his reputation as the doctor of sick mines[59]
after world war ii hoover's mining work in the kyshtym area of russia proved invaluable to american intelligence agencies they had been unable to find detailed maps of the area which contained the soviets' first military plutonium production facility at mayak making knowledge of the area vital in the event of war with the soviet union it was determined that hoover had given extremely detailed maps of the area to stanford university[60]
humanitarian work[edit] relief in europe and belgium[edit] poster for the american relief administration for belgium directed by hoover when world war i began in august 1914 hoover helped organize the return of around 120000 americans from europe he led 500 volunteers in distributing food clothing steamship tickets and cash[61] i did not realize it at the moment but on august 3 1914 my career was over forever i was on the slippery road of public life[62] hoover liked to say that the difference between dictatorship and democracy was simple dictators organize from the top down democracies from the bottom up
when belgium faced a food crisis after being invaded by germany in 1914 hoover undertook an unprecedented relief effort with the commission for relief in belgium (crb)[63] as chairman of the crb hoover worked with the leader of the belgian comit� national de secours et d'alimentation (cnsa) �mile francqui to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war the crb obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the cnsa to distribute and watched over the cnsa to make sure the german army didn't appropriate the food the crb became a veritable independent republic of relief with its own flag navy factories mills and railroads private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget[64]
for the next two years hoover worked 14-hour days from london administering the distribution of over two million tons of food to nine million war victims in an early form of shuttle diplomacy he crossed the north sea forty times to meet with german authorities and persuade them to allow food shipments becoming an international hero the belgian city of leuven named a prominent square hooverplein after him at its peak hoover's american relief administration (ara) fed 105 million people daily great britain grew reluctant to support the crb preferring instead to emphasize germany's obligation to supply the relief winston churchill whom hoover intensely disliked led a military faction that considered the belgian relief effort a positive military disaster
during this time hoover made a strong impression on the american ambassador to great britain walter page in a memoranda dated december 30 1916 page wrote mr herbert c hoover chairman of the commission for relief in belgium would if opportunity should offer make a useful officer in the state department he is probably the only man living who has privately (ie without holding office) negotiated understandings with the british french german dutch and belgian governments he personally knows and has had direct dealings with these governments and his transactions with them have involved several hundred million dollars he is a man of very considerable fortune�less than when the war began for tins relief work has cost him much he was approached on behalf of the british government with the suggestion that if he would become a british subject the government would be pleased to give him an important executive post and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him his answer was i'll do what i can for you with pleasure but i'll be damned if i'll give up my american citizenship�not on your life within the last six months two large financial organizations each independently have offered him $100000 a year to enter their service and an industrial company offered him $100000 to start with he declined them all when the belgian relief work recently struck a financial snag hoover by telegraph got the promise of a loan in the united states to the british and french governments for belgian relief of $150000000&#160 i do not know but i think he would be glad to turn his european experience to the patriotic use of our government he is forty-two years old a graduate of leland stanford jr university[65]
us food administration[edit] after the united states entered the war in april 1917 president woodrow wilson appointed hoover to head the us food administration which was created under the lever food control act in 1917 this was a position he actively sought though he later claimed it was thrust upon him he was convinced from his belgian work that centralization of authority was essential to any relief effort he demanded and got great power albeit not as much as he sought[66] hoover believed food will win the war and beginning on september 29 this slogan was introduced and put into frequent use[67]
he carefully selected men to assist in the agency leadership � alonzo taylor (technical abilities) robert taft (political associations) gifford pinchot (agricultural influence) and julius barnes (business acumen)[68] hoover established set days for people to avoid eating specified foods and save them for soldiers' rations meatless mondays wheatless wednesdays and when in doubt eat potatoes this program helped reduce consumption of foodstuffs needed overseas and avoided rationing at home it was dubbed hooverizing by government publicists in spite of hoover's continual orders that publicity should not mention him by name the agency employed a system of price controls and licensing requirements for suppliers to maximize production despite efforts to prevent it some companies reaped great profits[69]
post-war relief[edit] after the war as a member of the supreme economic council and head of the american relief administration hoover organized shipments of food for millions of starving people in central europe he used a newly formed quaker organization the american friends service committee to carry out much of the logistical work in europe
hoover provided aid to the defeated german nation after the war as well as relief to famine-stricken bolshevik-controlled areas of russia in 1921 despite the opposition of senator henry cabot lodge and other republicans when asked if he was not thus helping bolshevism hoover retorted twenty million people are starving whatever their politics they shall be fed the russian famine of 1921�22 claimed 6 million people[70] in july 1922 soviet author maxim gorky wrote to hoover
your help will enter history as a unique gigantic achievement worthy of the greatest glory which will long remain in the memory of millions of russians whom you have saved from death[71]
at war's end the new york times named hoover one of the ten most important living americans hoover confronted a world of political possibilities when he returned home in 1919 democratic party leaders saw him as a potential presidential candidate and president wilson privately preferred hoover as his successor there could not be a finer one asserted franklin d roosevelt then a rising star from new york hoover briefly considered becoming a democrat but he believed that 1920 would be a republican year also hoover confessed that he could not run for a party whose only member in his boyhood home had been the town drunk
hoover realized that he was in a unique position to collect information about the great war and its aftermath in 1919 he established the hoover war collection at stanford university he donated all the files of the commission for relief in belgium the us food administration and the american relief administration and pledged $50000 as an endowment scholars were sent to europe to collect pamphlets society publications government documents newspapers posters proclamations and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions that followed it the collection was later renamed the hoover war library and is now known as the hoover institution
secretary of commerce[edit] assistants william mccracken (left) & walter drake (right) with secretary hoover (center) hoover rejected the democratic party's overtures in 1920 he had been a registered republican before the war though he had supported theodore roosevelt's bull moose progressive party in 1912 now he declared himself a republican and a candidate for the presidency
he placed his name on the ballot in the california state primary election where he nearly beat popular senator hiram johnson but having lost in his home state hoover was not considered a serious contender at the convention even when it deadlocked for several ballots between illinois governor frank lowden and general leonard wood few delegates seriously considered hoover as a compromise choice although he had personal misgivings about the capability of the nominee warren g harding hoover publicly endorsed him and made two speeches for harding
hoover with president harding at a baseball game in 1921 after being elected harding rewarded hoover for his support offering to appoint him either secretary of the interior or secretary of commerce hoover ultimately chose commerce commerce had existed for just eight years since the division of the earlier department of commerce and labor commerce was considered a minor cabinet post with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities
hoover aimed to change that envisioning the commerce department as the hub of the nation's growth and stability from harding he demanded and received authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government he created many sub-departments and committees overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics the census and radio to air travel in some instances he seized control of responsibilities from other cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well hoover became one of the most visible men in the country often overshadowing presidents harding and coolidge washington wags referred to hoover as the secretary of commerce and under-secretary of everything else
as secretary and later as president hoover revolutionized relations between business and government rejecting the adversarial stance of theodore roosevelt william howard taft and woodrow wilson he sought to make the commerce department a powerful service organization empowered to forge cooperative voluntary partnerships between government and business this philosophy is often called associationalism both the us department of justice and the federal trade commission opposed hoover's goals[72] but the us supreme court ruled in maple flooring manufacturers' assn v united states 268 us 563 (1925) that hoover's policies served the public interest by producing fairer price levels and avoid[ing] waste[73]
many of hoover's efforts as commerce secretary centered on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency in business and industry this included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations reducing industrial losses from accident and injury and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping one major achievement was to promote product standardizations he promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen hoover was especially eager to promote hollywood films overseas[74]
his own your own home campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single-family dwellings with groups such as the better houses in america movement the architects' small house service bureau and the home modernizing bureau he worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long-term home mortgage which dramatically stimulated home construction[75]
it has been suggested that herbert hoover was the best secretary of commerce in united states history[76][77] hoover was the last president to have held a full cabinet position
radio conferences[edit] herbert hoover listening to a radio receiver hoover's radio conferences played a key role in the early organization development and regulation of radio broadcasting prior to the radio act of 1927 the secretary of commerce was unable to deny radio licensing or reassign broadcast frequencies with help from supporters senator dill and representative white hoover brought the issue of radio control to the senate floor hoover fought for more power to control the proliferation of licensed radio stations (which in 1927 stood at 732 stations) with help from dill and white hoover promoted the dill-white bill which eventually would become the radio act of 1927 this act allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed non-useful to the public hoover's attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all congressmen and he received much opposition from the senate and from radio station owners however hoover's contributions to regulate radio in its infancy heavily influenced the modern radio system[78]
hoover contributed to major projects for navigation irrigation of dry lands electrical power and flood control as the new air transport industry developed hoover held a conference on aviation to promote codes and regulations he became president of the american child health organization and he raised private funds to promote health education in schools and communities
although he continued to consider harding ill-suited to be president the two men nevertheless became friends hoover accompanied harding on his final trip out west in 1923 it was hoover who called for a specialist to tend to the ailing chief executive and it was also hoover who contacted the white house to inform them of the president's death the commerce secretary headed the group of dignitaries accompanying harding's body back to the capital
by the end of hoover's service as secretary he had raised the status of the department of commerce this was reflected in its modern headquarters built during the roosevelt administration in the 1930s in the federal triangle in washington dc
traffic conferences[edit] as commerce secretary hoover also hosted two national conferences on street traffic in 1924 and 1926 (a third convened in 1930 during hoover's presidency) collectively the meetings were called the national conference on street and highway safety hoover's chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards rules of the road and urban traffic control he left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves which were then presented for adoption by states and localities because automotive trade associations were the best organized many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests the conferences issued a model uniform vehicle code for adoption by the states and a model municipal traffic ordinance for adoption by cities both were widely influential promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets[79]
mississippi flood[edit] the great mississippi flood of 1927 broke the banks and levees of the lower mississippi river in early 1927 resulting in flooding of millions of acres and leaving 15 million people displaced from their homes although such a disaster did not fall under the duties of the commerce department the governors of six states along the mississippi specifically asked for herbert hoover in the emergency president calvin coolidge sent hoover to mobilize state and local authorities militia army engineers the coast guard and the american red cross
with a grant from the rockefeller foundation hoover set up health units to work in the flooded regions for a year these workers stamped out malaria pellagra and typhoid fever from many areas his work during the flood brought herbert hoover to the front page of newspapers almost everywhere and he gained new accolades as a humanitarian the great victory of his relief work he stressed was not that the government rushed in and provided all assistance it was that much of the assistance available was provided by private citizens and organizations in response to his appeals i suppose i could have called in the army to help he said but why should i when i only had to call upon main street
the treatment of african-americans during the disaster endangered hoover's reputation as a humanitarian local officials brutalized black farmers and prevented them from leaving relief camps aid intended for african-american sharecroppers was often given instead to the landowners and black men often were conscripted by locals into forced labor sometimes at gun point[80] knowing the potential damage to his presidential hopes if this became public hoover struck a deal with robert russa moton[81] the prominent african-american successor to booker t washington as president of the tuskegee institute in exchange for keeping the sufferings of african-americans quiet hoover promised unprecedented influence for african-americans should he become president moton agreed and following the accommodationist philosophy of washington he worked actively[81] to conceal the information from the media
presidential election of 1928[edit] main article united states presidential election 1928 republican primaries[edit] when president calvin coolidge announced in august 1927 that he would not seek a second full term of office in the 1928 presidential election hoover became the leading republican candidate despite the fact coolidge was lukewarm on hoover often deriding his ambitious and popular commerce secretary as wonder boy[82] coolidge had been reluctant to choose hoover as his successor on one occasion he remarked that for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice�all of it bad i was particularly offended by his comment to 'shit or get off the pot'[83] even so coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular commerce secretary's nomination[84]
hoover's only real challenger was frank orren lowden a former governor of illinois hoover received much favorable press coverage in the months leading up to the convention lowden's campaign manager complained that newspapers were full of nothing but advertisements for herbert hoover and fletcher's castoria hoover's reputation experience and popularity coalesced to give him the republican nomination on the first ballot
the delegates considered nominating vice president charles dawes to be hoover's running mate but coolidge (who hated dawes) remarked that this would be a personal affront to him the convention selected senator charles curtis of kansas[85]
general election[edit] hoover campaigned for efficiency and the republican record of prosperity against democrat alfred e smith smith likewise was a proponent of efficiency earned as governor of new york both candidates were pro-business and each promised to improve conditions for farmers reform immigration laws and maintain america's isolationist foreign policy where they differed was on the volstead act which outlawed the sale of liquor and beer smith was a wet who called for its repeal whereas hoover gave limited support for prohibition calling it an experiment noble in purpose his use of experiment suggested it was not permanent while smith won extra support among catholics in the big cities smith was the target of intense anti-catholicism from some protestant communities especially as southern baptists and german lutherans[86] overall the religious factor worked to the advantage of hoover although he took no part in it[87]
historians agree that hoover's national reputation and the booming economy combined with deep splits in the democratic party over religion and prohibition guaranteed his landslide victory with 58% of the vote[88] hoover's appeal to southern white voters succeeded in cracking the solid south winning the democratic strongholds of florida north carolina virginia texas and tennessee the deep south continued to support smith as the democratic candidate this was the first time that a republican candidate for president had carried texas this outraged the black leadership which largely broke from the republican party and began seeking candidates who supported civil rights within the democratic party[89]
presidency (1929�1933)[edit] inauguration of hoover see also inauguration of herbert hoover hoover held a press conference on his first day in office promising a new phase of press relations[90] he asked the group of journalists to elect a committee to recommend improvements to the white house press conference hoover declined to use a spokesman instead asking reporters to directly quote him and giving them handouts with his statements ahead of time in his first 120 days in office he held more regular and frequent press conferences than any other president before or since however he changed his press policies after the 1929 stock market crash screening reporters and greatly reducing his availability[90]
lou henry hoover was an activist first lady she typified the new woman of the post�world war i era intelligent robust and aware of multiple female possibilities[91]
white house physician admiral joel t boone invented the sport hooverball to keep hoover fit while in the white house hooverball is a combination of volleyball and tennis played with a 6 lb medicine ball hoover and several staff members played it each morning earning them the nickname medicine ball cabinet[92]
domestic policies[edit] herbert hoover as the new president of the united states original drawing for an oscar cesare political cartoon march 17 1929 on poverty hoover said that given the chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years we shall soon with the help of god be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation[93] and promised we in america today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land but within months the stock market crash of 1929 occurred and the world's economy spiraled downward into the great depression[94]
hoover entered office with a plan to reform the nation's regulatory system believing that a federal bureaucracy should have limited regulation over a country's economic system[95] a self-described progressive and reformer hoover saw the presidency as a vehicle for improving the conditions of all americans by encouraging public-private cooperation�what he termed volunteerism hoover saw volunteerism as preferable to governmental coercion or intervention which he saw as opposed to the american ideals of individualism and self-reliance[96] long before he had entered politics he had denounced laissez-faire thinking[97]
hoover expanded civil service coverage of federal positions canceled private oil leases on government lands and by instructing the justice department and the internal revenue service to pursue gangsters for tax evasion he enabled the prosecution of mobster al capone he appointed a commission that set aside 3000000 acres (12000&#160km�) of national parks and 2300000 acres of national forests advocated tax reduction for low-income americans (not enacted) closed certain tax loopholes for the wealthy doubled the number of veterans' hospital facilities negotiated a treaty on st lawrence seaway (which failed in the us senate) wrote a children's charter that advocated protection of every child regardless of race or gender created an antitrust division in the justice department required air mail carriers to adopt stricter safety measures and improve service proposed federal loans for urban slum clearances (not enacted) organized the federal bureau of prisons reorganized the bureau of indian affairs instituted prison reform proposed a federal department of education (not enacted) advocated $50-per-month pensions for americans over 65 (not enacted) chaired white house conferences on child health protection homebuilding and home-ownership began construction of the boulder dam (later renamed hoover dam) and signed the norris�la guardia act that limited judicial intervention in labor disputes[citation needed]
foreign relations[edit] on november 19 1928 hoover embarked on a seven-week goodwill tour of several latin american nations to outline his economic and trade policies to other nations in the western hemisphere
herbert hoover with his dog king tut following the release in 1930 of the clark memorandum hoover began formulating what would become roosevelt's good neighbor policy he began withdrawing american troops from nicaragua and haiti he also proposed an arms embargo on latin america and a one-third reduction of the world's naval power which was called the hoover plan the roosevelt corollary ceased being part of us foreign policy in response to the japanese invasion of manchuria he and secretary of state henry stimson outlined the hoover�stimson doctrine which held that the united states would not recognize territories gained by force[98]
hoover mediated between chile and peru to solve a conflict on the sovereignty of arica and tacna that in 1883 by the treaty of anc�n had been awarded to chile for ten years to be followed by a plebiscite that had never happened by the tacna�arica compromise at the treaty of lima in 1929 chile kept arica and peru regained tacna
civil rights[edit] hoover seldom mentioned civil rights while he was president he believed that african-americans and other races could improve themselves with education and wanted the races assimilated into white culture[99]
hoover attempted to appoint john j parker of north carolina to the supreme court in 1930 to replace edward sanford the naacp claimed that parker had made many court decisions against african-americans and they fought the nomination the naacp was successful in gaining senator william borah's support and the nomination was defeated by two votes (39-41) in the senate[100]
first lady lou hoover defied custom and invited the wife of republican oscar depriest the only african-american member in congress to tea at the white house booker t washington was the previous african-american to have dined at the white house with theodore roosevelt in 1901[101]
charles curtis the nation's first native american vice president was from the kaw tribe in kansas[102] hoover's humanitarian and quaker reputation along with curtis as a vice-president gave special meaning to his indian policies his quaker upbringing influenced his views that native americans needed to achieve economic self-sufficiency as president he appointed charles j rhoads as commissioner of indian affairs hoover supported rhoads' commitment to indian assimilation and sought to minimize the federal role in indian affairs his goal was to have indians acting as individuals (not as tribes) and to assume the responsibilities of citizenship granted with the indian citizenship act of 1924[103]
great depression[edit] main article great depression in the united states hoover had long been a proponent of the concept that public-private cooperation was the way to achieve high long-term growth[104] hoover feared that too much government intervention would undermine long-term individuality and self-reliance which he considered essential to the nation's future both his ideals and the economy were put to the test with the onset of the great depression[105]
although many people at the time and for decades afterwards denounced hoover for taking a hands-off (laissez-faire) approach to the depression[106] a few historians emphasize how active he actually was hoover said he rejected treasury secretary andrew mellon's suggested leave-it-alone approach[107] and called many business leaders to washington to urge them not to lay off workers or cut wages[108]
herbert hoover in the oval office with ted joslin 1932 libertarian economist murray rothbard argues that hoover was actually the initiator of what came to be the new deal hoover engaged in many unprecedented public works programs including an increase in the federal buildings program of over $400 million and the establishment of the division of public construction to spur public works planning hoover himself granted more subsidies to ship construction through the federal shipping board and asked for a further $175 million appropriation for public works this was followed in july 1930 with the expenditure of a giant $915 million public works program including a hoover dam on the colorado river[109][110] in the spring of 1930 hoover acquired from congress an added $100 million to continue the federal farm board lending and purchasing policies at the end of 1929 the ffb established a national wool cooperative-the national wool marketing corporation (nwmc) made up of 30 state associations the board also established an allied national wool credit corporation to handle finances a total of $315 million in loans for wool were made by the ffb of which $125 million were permanently lost these massive agricultural subsidies were a precedent for the later agricultural adjustment act[111][112] hoover also advocated strong labor regulation law including the enactment of the bacon-davis act requiring a maximum eight-hour day on construction of public buildings and the payment of at least the prevailing wage in the locality as well as the norris-laguardia act in 1932 in the banking sector hoover passed the federal home loan bank act in july 1932 establishing 12 district banks ruled by a federal home loan bank board in a manner similar to the federal reserve system $125 million capital was subscribed by the treasury and this was subsequently shifted to the rfc hoover was also instrumental in passing the glass-steagall act of 1932 allowing for prime rediscounting at the federal reserve allowing further inflation of credit and bank reserves[113]
lee ohanian from ucla argues that hoover adopted pro-labor policies after the 1929 stock market crash that accounted for close to two-thirds of the drop in the nation's gross domestic product over the two years that followed causing what might otherwise have been a bad recession to slip into the great depression[114] this argument is at odds with the more keynesian view of the causes of the depression and has been challenged as revisionist by j bradford delong of uc berkeley[115]
president hoover with amelia earhart in 1932 calls for greater government assistance increased as the us economy continued to decline he was also a firm believer in balanced budgets (as were most democrats) and was unwilling to run a budget deficit to fund welfare programs[116] however hoover did pursue many policies in an attempt to pull the country out of depression in 1929 he authorized the mexican repatriation program to help unemployed mexican citizens return home the program was largely a forced migration of approximately 500000 people to mexico and continued until 1937 in june 1930 over the objection of many economists congress approved and hoover reluctantly signed into law the smoot�hawley tariff act the legislation raised tariffs on thousands of imported items the intent of the act was to encourage the purchase of american-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers however economic depression had spread worldwide and canada france and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs on imports from the us the result was to contract international trade and worsen the depression[117]
in 1931 hoover issued the hoover moratorium calling for a one-year halt in reparation payments by germany to france and in the payment of allied war debts to the united states the plan was met with much opposition especially from france who saw significant losses to germany during world war i the moratorium did little to ease economic declines as the moratorium neared its expiration the following year an attempt to find a permanent solution was made at the lausanne conference of 1932 a working compromise was never established and by the start of world war ii reparations payments had stopped completely[118][119] hoover in 1931 urged the major banks in the country to form a consortium known as the national credit corporation (ncc)[120]
in the us by 1932 unemployment had reached 249%[121] businesses defaulted on record numbers of loans and more than 5000 banks had failed[122] hundreds of thousands of americans found themselves homeless and began congregating in the numerous hoovervilles (shanty towns) that sprang up in major cities
congress desperate to increase federal revenue enacted the revenue act of 1932 which was the largest peacetime tax increase in history[123] the act increased taxes across the board so that top earners were taxed at 63% on their net income the 1932 act also increased the tax on the net income of corporations from 12% to 1375%
the final attempt of the hoover administration to rescue the economy occurred in 1932 with the passage of the emergency relief and construction act which authorized funds for public works programs and the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation (rfc) the rfc's initial goal was to provide government-secured loans to financial institutions railroads and farmers the rfc had minimal impact at the time but was adopted by president franklin d roosevelt and greatly expanded as part of his new deal
taxes revenues and deficits[edit] national debt as a fraction of gnp up from 20% to 40% under hoover from historical statistics us (1976) to pay for these and other government programs and to make up for revenue lost due to the depression in addition to the revenue act of 1932 hoover agreed to roll back several tax cuts that his administration had enacted on upper incomes the estate tax was doubled and corporate taxes were raised by almost 15% also a check tax was included that placed a 2-cent tax (over 30 cents in today's economy) on all bank checks economists william d lastrapes and george selgin[124] conclude that the check tax was an important contributing factor to that period's severe monetary contraction hoover also encouraged congress to investigate the new york stock exchange and this pressure resulted in various reforms
herbert and lou henry hoover aboard a train in illinois bonus army[edit] main article bonus army thousands of world war i veterans and their families demonstrated and camped out in washington dc during june 1932 calling for immediate payment of a bonus that had been promised by the world war adjusted compensation act in 1924 for payment in 1945 although offered money by congress to return home some members of the bonus army remained washington police attempted to remove the demonstrators from their camp but they were outnumbered and unsuccessful shots were fired by the police in a futile attempt to attain order and two protesters were killed while many officers were injured hoover sent us army forces led by general douglas macarthur and helped by lower ranking officers dwight d eisenhower and george s patton to stop a march macarthur believing he was fighting a communist revolution chose to clear out the camp with military force in the ensuing clash hundreds of civilians were injured hoover had sent orders that the army was not to move on the encampment but macarthur chose to ignore the command hoover was incensed but refused to reprimand macarthur the entire incident was another devastating negative for hoover in the 1932 election that led new york governor and democratic presidential candidate franklin roosevelt to declare of hoover there is nothing inside the man but jelly
administration and cabinet[edit] hoover's cabinet the hoover cabinet office name term president herbert hoover 1929�1933 vice president charles curtis 1929�1933 secretary of state frank b kellogg 1929 henry l stimson 1929�1933 secretary of treasury andrew mellon 1929�1932 ogden l mills 1932�1933 secretary of war james w good 1929 patrick j hurley 1929�1933 attorney general william d mitchell 1929�1933 postmaster general walter f brown 1929�1933 secretary of the navy charles f adams 1929�1933 secretary of the interior ray l wilbur 1929�1933 secretary of agriculture arthur m hyde 1929�1933 secretary of commerce robert p lamont 1929�1932 roy d chapin 1932�1933 secretary of labor james j davis 1929�1930 william n doak 1930�1933 supreme court appointments[edit] main article herbert hoover supreme court candidates hoover appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states[125]
supreme court appointments by president herbert hoover position name term chief justice charles evans hughes 1930�1941 associate justice owen roberts 1930�1945 benjamin n cardozo 1932�1938 hoover broke party lines to appoint the democrat cardozo he explained that he was one of the ancient believers that the supreme court should have a strong minority of the opposition's party and that all appointments should be made from experienced jurists when the vacancy came [hoover] canvassed all the possible democratic jurists and immediately concluded that justice cardozo was the right man and appointed him[126]
1932 re-election campaign[edit] hoover addresses a large crowd in his 1932 campaign main article united states presidential election 1932 although hoover had come to detest the presidency he agreed to run again in 1932 not only as a matter of pride but also because he feared that no other likely republican candidate would deal with the depression without resorting to what hoover considered dangerously radical measures
hoover was nominated by the republicans for a second term he had originally planned to make only one or two major speeches and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies but when polls showed the entire republican ticket facing a resounding defeat at the polls hoover agreed to an expanded schedule of public addresses in his nine major radio addresses hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy the apologetic approach did not allow hoover to refute democratic nominee franklin roosevelt's charge that he was personally responsible for the depression[127]
in his campaign trips around the country hoover was faced with perhaps the most hostile crowds of any sitting president besides having his train and motorcades pelted with eggs and rotten fruit he was often heckled while speaking and on several occasions the secret service halted attempts to kill hoover by disgruntled citizens including capturing one man nearing hoover carrying sticks of dynamite and another already having removed several spikes from the rails in front of the president's train[128]
franklin d roosevelt blasted hoover for spending and taxing too much increasing national debt raising tariffs and blocking trade as well as placing millions on the government dole roosevelt attacked hoover for reckless and extravagant spending of thinking that we ought to center control of everything in washington as rapidly as possible[129] roosevelt's running mate john nance garner accused the republican of leading the country down the path of socialism[130]
osro cobb a leader of the republican party in arkansas who became politically and personally close to hoover recalls
president hoover had become convinced that the democrats deliberately were destroying the economy of the country and erecting roadblocks against every measure he offered to the congress to restore balance to the economy  all for the purpose of winning an election just a few weeks before the 1932 election we were standing near a window in the oval office his cigar was frayed and out and he was in deep thought and obviously troubled he turned aside and said that he had accepted a speaking engagement in des moines iowa in three days and that the us secret service had warned him that it had uncovered evidence of plots by radical elements to assassinate him if he kept it turmoil and uncertainty prevailed in the country but there was absolutely no fear in his expression to the contrary there appeared to be an abundance of personal courage frankly my heart went out to him but i pointed out that fate and destiny played a part in the lives of all presidents and that i felt all possible precautions should be taken to protect him but that he should appear and make one of the greatest speeches of his administration he smiled and said osro that's what i have already decided to do your concurrence is comforting [131]
despite the late campaign endeavors hoover sustained a large defeat in the election having procured only 397 percent of the popular vote to roosevelt's 574 percent hoover's popular vote was reduced by 26 percentage points from his result in the 1928 election in the electoral college he carried only pennsylvania delaware and four other northeastern states to lose 59�472 the democrats extended their control over the us house and gained control of the us senate
after the election hoover requested that roosevelt retain the gold standard as the basis of the us currency and in effect continue many of the hoover administration's economic policies roosevelt refused[132]
post-presidency[edit] hoover with franklin d roosevelt march 4 1933 hoover departed from washington in march 1933 with some bitterness disappointed both that he had been repudiated by the voters and unappreciated for his best efforts the hoovers went first to new york city where they stayed for a while in the waldorf-astoria hotel later that spring they returned to california to their stanford residence hoover enjoyed returning to the men's clubs that he had long been involved with including the bohemian club the pacific-union club and the university club in san francisco[133]
hoover liked to drive his car accompanied by his wife or a friend (former presidents did not get secret service protection until the 1960s) and drive on wandering journeys visiting western mining camps or small towns where he often went unrecognized or heading up to the mountains or deep into the woods to go fishing in relative solitude a year before his death his own fishing days behind him he published fishing for fun�and to wash your soul the last of more than sixteen books in his lifetime
hoover fishing in his home state of iowa although many of his friends and supporters called upon hoover to speak out against fdr's new deal and to assume his place as the voice of the loyal opposition he refused to do so for many years after leaving the white house and he largely kept himself out of the public spotlight until late in 1934 however that did not stop rumors springing up about him often fanned by democratic politicians who found the former president to be a convenient scapegoat
the relationship between hoover and roosevelt was one of the most severely strained in presidential history hoover had little good to say about his successor fdr in turn supposedly engaged in various petty official acts aimed at his predecessor ranging from dropping him from the white house birthday greetings message list to having hoover's name struck from the hoover dam on the colorado river which would officially be known only as boulder dam for many years to come
hoover's book fishing for fun � and to wash your soul in 1936 hoover entertained hopes of receiving the republican presidential nomination again and thus facing roosevelt in a rematch however although he retained strong support among some delegates there was never much hope of his being selected he publicly endorsed the nominee kansas governor alf landon but hoover might as well have been the nominee since the democrats virtually ignored landon and they ran against the former president himself constantly attacking him in speeches and warning that a landon victory would put hoover back in the white house as the secret power behind the throne roosevelt won 46 of the 48 states burying landon in the electoral college and the republican party in congress in another landslide
although hoover's reputation was at its low point circumstances began to rehabilitate his name and restore him to prominence roosevelt overreached on his supreme court packing plan and a further financial recession in 1937 and 1938 tarnished his image of invincibility
in 1939 former president herbert hoover became the first honorary chairman of tolstoy foundation in valley cottage new york served in this capacity until his death in 1964[134]
by 1940 hoover was again being spoken of as the possible nominee of the party in the presidential election although he trailed in the polls behind thomas dewey arthur vandenberg and his own former protege robert a taft he still had considerable first-ballot delegate strength and it was believed that if the convention deadlocked between the leading candidates the party might turn to him as its compromise however the convention nominated the utility company president wendell willkie who had supported roosevelt in 1932 but turned against him after the creation of the tennessee valley authority forced him to sell his company hoover dutifully supported willkie although he despaired that the nominee endorsed a platform that to hoover was little more than the new deal in all but name
road to war and world war ii[edit] hoover visited 10 european countries in march 1938 the month of nazi germany's anschluss of austria and stated i do not believe a widespread war is at all probable in the near future there is a general realization everywhere  that civilization as we know it cannot survive another great war[135] like many he initially believed that the european allies would be able to contain germany and that imperial japan would not attack american interests in the pacific
unlike roosevelt's administration hoover was a vocal supporter of providing relief to countries in nazi-occupied europe[136] he was instrumental in creating the commission for polish relief and finnish relief fund[137][138]
when the germans overran france and then had britain held in a stalemate many americans saw britain as on the verge of collapse nonetheless hoover declared that it would be folly for the united states to declare war on germany and to rush to save the united kingdom rather he held it was far wiser for this nation to devote itself to building up its own defenses and to wash its hands of the mess in europe he called for a fortress america concept in which the united states protected on the east and on the west by vast oceans patrolled by its navy and its air corps (the usaaf) could adequately repel any attack on the americas
during a radio broadcast on june 29 1941 one week after the nazi invasion of the soviet union hoover disparaged any tacit alliance between the us and the ussr by saying
if we go further and join the war and we win then we have won for stalin the grip of communism on russia again i say if we join the war and stalin wins we have aided him to impose more communism on europe and the world at least we could not with such a bedfellow say to our sons that by making the supreme sacrifice they are restoring freedom to the world war alongside stalin to impose freedom is more than a travesty it is a tragedy[139]
when the united states entered the war following the december 7 1941 japanese attack on pearl harbor hoover swept aside all feelings of neutrality and called for total victory he offered himself to the government in any capacity necessary but the roosevelt administration did not call upon him to serve
post�world war ii[edit] herbert hoover with his son allan (left) and his grandson andrew (above) 1950 following world war ii hoover became friends with president harry s truman hoover joked that they were for many years the sole members of the trade union of former presidents (since calvin coolidge and roosevelt were dead already) because of hoover's previous experience with germany at the end of world war i in 1946 president truman selected the former president to tour germany to ascertain the food status of the occupied nation hoover toured what was to become west germany in hermann g�ring's old train coach and produced a number of reports critical of us occupation policy the economy of germany had sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years[140] he stated in one report
there is the illusion that the new germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a pastoral state it cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25000000 people out of it[141]
on hoover's initiative a school meals program in the american and british occupation zones of germany was begun on april 14 1947 the program served 3500000 children aged six through 18 a total of 40000 tons of american food was provided during the hooverspeisung (hoover meals)
in 1947 president harry s truman appointed hoover to a commission which elected him chairman to reorganize the executive departments this became known as the hoover commission he was appointed chairman of a similar commission by president dwight d eisenhower in 1953 both found numerous inefficiencies and ways to reduce waste the government enacted most of the recommendations that the two commissions had made 71% of the first commission's and 64% of the second commission's
throughout the cold war hoover always an opponent of marxism became even more outspokenly anti-communist[142] however he vehemently opposed american involvement in the korean war saying that to commit the sparse ground forces of the non-communist nations into a land war against this communist land mass [in asia] would be a war without victory a war without a successful political terminal that would be the graveyard of millions of american boys and the exhaustion of the united states[143]
hoover's official white house portrait painted by elmer wesley greene despite his advancing years hoover continued to work nearly full-time both on writing (among his literary works is the ordeal of woodrow wilson a bestseller and the first time one former president had ever written a biography about another) as well as overseeing the hoover institution at stanford university which housed not only his own professional papers but also those of a number of other former high ranking governmental and military servants he also threw himself into fund-raising for the boys clubs (now the boys & girls clubs of america) which became his pet charity
final years and death[edit] from coolidge's death in 1933 to dwight d eisenhower's last day of serving the presidency in 1961 hoover had been the only living republican former president in 1960 hoover appeared at his final republican national convention since the 1948 convention he had been feted as the guest of farewell ceremonies (the unspoken assumption being that the aging former president might not survive until the next convention) joking to the delegates he said apparently my last three good-byes didn't take although he lived to see the 1964 convention ill health prevented him from attending the presidential nominee barry goldwater acknowledged hoover's absence in his acceptance speech in 1962 hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed ten months later he had severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seemed terminally ill and frail but his mind was clear and he maintained a great deal of correspondence although the illness would get worse over time he refused to be hospitalized
hoover died following massive internal bleeding at the age of 90 in his new york city suite at 1135&#160am on october 20 1964[144] 31 years seven months and sixteen days after leaving office at the time of his death he had the longest retirement of any president former president jimmy carter surpassed the length of hoover's retirement on september 7 2012 at the time of hoover's death he was the second longest-lived president after john adams both were since surpassed by gerald ford ronald reagan george h w bush and jimmy carter he had outlived by 20 years his wife lou henry hoover who had died in 1944 and he was the last living member of the coolidge administration he also outlived both his successor franklin d roosevelt and eleanor roosevelt who died in 1945 and 1962 respectively hoover was the last president to be the only living ex-president until the death of lyndon b johnson in 1973 thus making richard nixon the most recent president to be the only living ex-president hoover's time as only living president was also the shortest in history at one day less than two months
by the time of his death he had rehabilitated his image[145] his birthplace in iowa and an oregon home where he lived as a child became national landmarks during his lifetime his rapidan fishing camp in virginia which he had donated to the government in 1933 is now a national historic landmark within the shenandoah national park hoover and his wife are buried at the herbert hoover presidential library and museum in west branch iowa hoover was honored with a state funeral the last of three in a span of 12 months coming as it did just after the deaths of president john f kennedy and general douglas macarthur former chaplain of the senate frederick brown harris officiated all three had two things in common the commanding general of the military district of washington during those funerals was army major general philip c wehle and the riderless horse was black jack who also served in that role during lyndon b johnson's funeral
writing[edit] hoover began his magnum opus freedom betrayed[146] in 1944 as part of a proposed autobiography this turned into a significant work critiquing the foreign policy of the united states during the period from the 1930s to 1945 essentially an attack on the statesmanship of franklin d roosevelt hoover completed this work in his 90th year but it was not published until the historian george h nash took on the task of editing it significant themes are his belief that the western democratic powers should have let nazi germany and soviet russia assail and weaken each other and opposition to the british guarantee of poland's independence[147]
