planter religion methodist (formerly presbyterianism) signature james knox polk (november 2 1795 � june 15 1849) was the 11th president of the united states (1845�1849) polk was born in mecklenburg county north carolina[1] he later lived in and represented tennessee a democrat polk served as the 17th speaker of the house of representatives (1835�1839) and governor of tennessee (1839�1841) polk was the surprise (dark horse) candidate for president in 1844 defeating henry clay of the rival whig party by promising to annex texas polk was a leader of jacksonian democracy during the second party system
polk is often considered the last strong pre�civil war president and he is the earliest of whom surviving photographs were taken during a term in office many scholars and historians have commented on his interventionist foreign policy he threatened war with the united kingdom over the issue of which nation owned the oregon country then backed away and split the ownership of the region with the uk when mexico rejected american annexation of texas polk also led the nation to a sweeping victory in the mexican�american war which gave the united states most of its present southwest he secured passage of the walker tariff of 1846 which had low rates that pleased his native south and he established a treasury system that lasted until 1913
polk oversaw the opening of the us naval academy and the smithsonian institution the groundbreaking for the washington monument and the issuance of the first postage stamps in the united states he promised to serve only one term and did not run for reelection he died of cholera three months after his term ended
scholars have ranked him favorably on lists of greatest presidents for his ability to promote obtain support for and achieve all of the major items on his presidential agenda polk has been called the least known consequential president[2] of the united states

early life reconstructed log cabin similar to one young james k polk lived in at the pres james k polk state historic site near pineville james knox polk the first of ten children was born on november 2 1795 in a farmhouse (possibly a log cabin)[1] in what is now pineville north carolina in mecklenburg county just outside charlotte[3] his father samuel polk was a slaveholder successful farmer and surveyor of scots-irish descent his mother jane polk (n�e knox) was a descendant of a brother of the scottish religious reformer john knox she named her firstborn after her father james knox[3] like most early scots-irish settlers in the north carolina mountains the knox and polk families were presbyterian while jane remained a devout presbyterian her entire life samuel (whose father ezekiel polk was a deist) rejected dogmatic presbyterianism when the parents took james to church to be baptized the father samuel refused to declare his belief in christianity and the minister refused to baptize the child[3][4] in 1803 most of polk's relatives moved to the duck river area in what is now maury county middle tennessee polk's family waited until 1806 to follow[5] the family grew prosperous with samuel polk turning to land speculation and becoming a county judge[5] polk was home schooled[5] his health was problematic and in 1812 his pain became so unbearable that he was taken to dr ephraim mcdowell of danville kentucky who operated to remove urinary stones[6] polk was awake during the operation with nothing but brandy available for anesthetic but it was successful the surgery may have left polk sterile as he did not sire any children[7]
the house where polk spent his adult life before his presidency in columbia tennessee is his only private residence still standing it is now known as the james k polk ancestral home when polk recovered his father offered to bring him into the mercantile business but polk refused[6] in july 1813 polk enrolled at the zion church near his home a year later he attended an academy in murfreesboro where he may have met his future wife sarah childress[8] at murfreesboro polk proved a promising student in january 1816 he transferred and was admitted into the university of north carolina as a second-semester sophomore the polks had connections with the university then a small school of about 80 students sam polk was their land agent for tennessee and his cousin william polk was a trustee[9] while there polk joined the dialectic society where he regularly took part in debates and learned the art of oratory his roommate william dunn moseley later became the first governor of florida polk graduated with honors in may 1818[10] the university later named the lower quad on its main campus polk place[11]
after graduation polk traveled to nashville to study law under renowned nashville trial attorney felix grundy[12] grundy became polk's first mentor on september 20 1819 polk with grundy's endorsement was elected clerk for the tennessee state senate[13] polk was reelected as clerk in 1821 without opposition and would continue to serve until 1822 polk was admitted to the bar in june 1820 and his first case was to defend his father against a public fighting charge and secure his release for a one dollar fine[13] polk's practice was successful as there were many cases arising from debts after the panic of 1819[14]
early political career in 1822 polk joined the tennessee militia as a captain in the cavalry regiment of the 5th brigade he was later appointed a colonel on the staff of governor william carroll and was afterwards often referred to or addressed by his military title[15][16] polk's oratory became popular earning him the nickname napoleon of the stump in 1822 polk resigned his position as clerk to run his successful campaign for the tennessee state legislature in 1823 in which he defeated incumbent william yancey becoming the new representative of maury county[15][17] in october 1823 polk voted for andrew jackson to become the next united states senator from tennessee[18] jackson won and from then on polk was a firm supporter of jackson[19]
james k polk and sarah childress polk polk courted sarah childress and they married on january 1 1824 in murfreesboro[17] polk was then 28 and sarah was 20 years old they had no children during polk's political career sarah assisted her husband with his speeches gave him advice on policy matters and played an active role in his campaigns an old story told that andrew jackson had encouraged their romance when they began to court[20]
in 1824 jackson ran for president but was defeated[21] though jackson had won the popular vote neither he nor any of the other candidates (john quincy adams henry clay and william h crawford) had won a majority of the electoral vote the house of representatives then had to select the verdict clay who had received the least amount of electoral votes and dropped from the ballot supported adams[21] clay's support proved to be the deciding factor in the house and adams was elected president[21] adams then offered clay a position in the cabinet as secretary of state[21]
presidential $1 coin of polk in 1825 polk ran for the united states house of representatives for the tennessee's 6th congressional district[22] polk vigorously campaigned in the district polk was so active that sarah began to worry about his health[22] during the campaign polk's opponents said that at the age of 29 polk was too young for a spot in the house but he won the election and took his seat in congress[22] when polk arrived in washington dc he roomed in benjamin burch's boarding house with some other tennessee representatives including sam houston polk made his first major speech on march 13 1826 in which he said that the electoral college should be abolished and that the president should be elected by the popular vote[23] after congress went into recess in the summer of 1826 polk returned to tennessee to see sarah and when congress met again in the autumn polk returned to washington with sarah in 1827 polk was reelected to congress[24] in 1828 jackson ran for president again and during the campaign polk and jackson corresponded with polk giving jackson advice on his campaign with jackson's victory in the election polk began to support the administration's position in congress[25] during this time polk continued to be reelected in the house in august 1833 after being elected to this fifth term polk became the chair of the house ways and means committee[26]
speaker of the house in june 1834 speaker of the house andrew stevenson resigned leaving the spot for speaker open[27] polk ran against fellow tennessean john bell for speaker and after ten ballots bell won however in 1835 polk ran against bell for speaker again and won[28]
polk worked for jackson's policies as speaker and van buren's when he succeeded jackson in 1837 he appointed committees with democratic chairs and majorities including the new york radical c c cambreleng as chair of the ways and means committee although he maintained the facade of traditional bipartisanship[29] the two major issues during polk's speakership were slavery and the economy after the panic of 1837 van buren and polk faced pressure to rescind the specie circular an act that had been signed by jackson to boost the economy the act required that payment for government lands be in gold and silver however with support from polk and his cabinet van buren chose to stick with the specie circular[30]
polk attempted to make a more orderly house he never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor as was customary then[31] polk also issued the gag rule on petitions from abolitionists[31]
polk remains the only president who served as speaker of the house
governor of tennessee in 1838 the political situation in tennessee�where in 1835 democrats had lost the governorship for the first time in their party's history�persuaded polk to return to help the party at home[32] leaving congress in 1839 polk became a candidate in the tennessee gubernatorial election defeating the incumbent whig newton cannon by about 2500 votes out of about 105000[33]
polk's three major programs during his governorship regulating state banks implementing state internal improvements and improving education all did not get approval by the legislature[34] in the presidential election of 1840 van buren was overwhelmingly defeated by a popular whig william henry harrison polk received one electoral vote from tennessee for vice president in the election[35] polk lost his own reelection to james c jones in 1841 by 3243 votes[36] he challenged jones in 1843 campaigning across the state and publicly debating against jones but was defeated again this time by a slightly greater margin of 3833 votes[37][38]
election of 1844 results of the 1844 presidential election main article united states presidential election 1844 polk initially hoped to be nominated for vice president at the democratic convention which began on may 27 1844[39] the leading contender for the presidential nomination was former president martin van buren[40] who wanted to stop the expansion of slavery other candidates included james buchanan general lewis cass cave johnson john c calhoun and levi woodbury the primary point of political contention involved the republic of texas which after declaring independence from mexico in 1836 had asked to join the united states but was refused by washington van buren opposed the annexation but in doing so lost the support of many democrats including former president andrew jackson who still had much influence van buren won a simple majority on the convention's first ballot but did not attain the two-thirds supermajority required for nomination in subsequent rounds the vote swung toward cass but he also fell short of the supermajority when it became clear after another six ballots that neither of the front-runners would win the required majority polk emerged as a dark horse candidate after an indecisive eighth ballot the convention unanimously nominated polk
1844 campaign banner produced by nathaniel currier portrait of james k polk before the convention jackson told polk that he was his favorite for the nomination of the democratic party even with this support polk instructed his managers at the convention to support van buren if he could win the nomination this assured that if a deadlocked convention occurred initial supporters of van buren would pick polk as a compromise candidate for the democrats in the end this is exactly what happened as a result of polk's support of westward expansion[41]
when advised of his nomination polk replied it has been well observed that the office of president of the united states should neither be sought nor declined i have never sought it nor should i feel at liberty to decline it if conferred upon me by the voluntary suffrages of my fellow citizens because the democratic party was splintered into bitter factions polk promised to serve only one term if elected hoping that his disappointed rival democrats would unite behind him with the knowledge that another candidate would be chosen in four years[42]
polk's whig opponent in the 1844 presidential election was henry clay of kentucky (incumbent president john tyler�a former democrat and whig�had been expelled from the whig party in september 1841 and was not nominated for a second term) the annexation of texas which was at the forefront during the democratic convention again dominated the campaign polk was a strong proponent of immediate annexation while clay seemed more equivocal and vacillating
another campaign issue also related to westward expansion involved the oregon country then under the joint occupation of the united states and the united kingdom the democrats had championed the cause of expansion informally linking the controversial texas annexation issue with a claim to the entire oregon country thus appealing to both northern and southern expansionists (the slogan fifty-four forty or fight often incorrectly attributed to the 1844 election did not appear until later see oregon boundary dispute) polk's consistent support for westward expansion�what democrats would later call manifest destiny�likely played an important role in his victory as his opponent clay hedged his position
in the election polk and his running mate george m dallas won in the south and west while clay drew support in the northeast polk lost both his birth state north carolina and his state of residence tennessee the most recent successful presidential candidate to do so however he won new york where clay lost votes to the antislavery liberty party candidate james g birney also contributing to polk's victory was the support of new immigrant voters who opposed the whigs' policies polk won the popular vote by a margin of about 39000 out of 26&#160million and took the electoral college with 170 votes to clay's 105[43] polk won 15 states while clay won 11[44]
presidency (1845�1849) filepolk james-president (bep engraved portrait)jpg bep engraved portrait of polk as president president polk (d 1849) photograph by mathew brady when he took office on march 4 1845 polk at 49 became the youngest man at the time to assume the presidency according to a story told decades later by george bancroft polk set four clearly defined goals for his administration
reestablish the independent treasury system reduce tariffs acquire some or all of oregon country acquire california and new mexico from mexico pledged to serve only one term he accomplished all these objectives in just four years by linking acquisition of new lands in oregon (with no slavery) and texas (with slavery) he hoped to satisfy both north and south
during his presidency james k polk was known as young hickory an allusion to his mentor andrew jackson and napoleon of the stump for his speaking skills
fiscal policy in 1846 congress approved the walker tariff (named after robert j walker the secretary of the treasury) which represented a substantial reduction of the high whig-backed tariff of 1842[45] the new law abandoned ad valorem tariffs and set rates independent of the monetary value of the product polk's actions were popular in the south and west however they were despised by many protectionists in pennsylvania
in 1846 polk approved a law restoring the independent treasury system under which government funds were held in the treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions this established independent treasury deposit offices separate from private or state banks to receive all government funds
rivers and harbors veto congress passed the rivers and harbors bill in 1846 to provide $500000 to improve rivers and harbors but polk vetoed the bill it would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas including ports which had no foreign trade polk believed that these problems were local and not national polk feared that passing the rivers and harbors bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts � a type of corruption that would spell doom to the virtue of the republic[46] in this regard he followed his hero andrew jackson who had vetoed the maysville road bill in 1830 on similar grounds[47]
slavery president polk 1858 portrait by george healy during his presidency many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the slave power and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported annexing texas and later war with mexico[48] polk stated in his diary that he believed slavery could not exist in the territories won from mexico[49] but refused to endorse the wilmot proviso that would forbid it there polk argued instead for extending the missouri compromise line to the pacific ocean which would prohibit the expansion of slavery above 36� 30' west of missouri but allow it below that line if approved by eligible voters in the territory william dusinberre has argued that polk's diary which he kept during his presidency was written for later publication and does not represent polk's policy
polk was a slaveholder for his entire life his father samuel polk had left polk more than 8000 acres (32&#160km�) of land and divided about 53 slaves to his widow and children after he died james inherited twenty of his father's slaves either directly or from deceased brothers in 1831 he became an absentee cotton planter sending slaves to clear plantation land that his father had left him near somerville tennessee four years later polk sold his somerville plantation and together with his brother-in-law bought 920 acres (37&#160km�) of land a cotton plantation near coffeeville mississippi he ran this plantation for the rest of his life eventually taking it over completely from his brother-in-law polk rarely sold slaves although once he became president and could better afford it he bought more polk's will stipulated that their slaves were to be freed after his wife sarah had died however the 1863 emancipation proclamation and the 1865 thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution freed all remaining slaves in rebel states long before the death of his wife in 1891[50]
foreign policy polk strongly supported expansion democrats believed that opening up more land for yeoman farmers was critical for the success of republican virtue (see manifest destiny) like most southerners he supported the annexation of texas to balance the interests of north and south he wanted to acquire the oregon country (present-day oregon washington idaho and british columbia) as well he sought to purchase california which mexico had neglected
oregon territory main article oregon boundary dispute the oregon territory established by the oregon treaty polk put heavy pressure on britain to resolve the oregon boundary dispute since 1818 the territory had been under the joint occupation and control of the united kingdom and the united states previous us administrations had offered to divide the region along the 49th parallel which was not acceptable to britain as they had commercial interests along the columbia river although the democratic platform asserted a claim to the entire region polk was willing to compromise when the british again refused to accept the 49th parallel boundary proposal polk broke off negotiations and returned to the democratic platform's all oregon demand (which called for all of oregon up to the 54-40 line that marked the southern boundary of russian alaska) 54-40 or fight now became a popular rallying cry among democrats[51]
polk wanted territory not war so he compromised with the british foreign secretary lord aberdeen the oregon treaty of 1846 divided the oregon country along the 49th parallel the original american proposal although there were many who still clamored for the entire territory the treaty was approved by the senate by settling for the 49th parallel polk angered many midwestern democrats many of these democrats believed that polk had always wanted the boundary at the 49th and that he had fooled them into believing he wanted it at the 54th parallel the portion of the oregon territory acquired by the united states later formed the states of washington oregon and idaho and parts of the states of montana and wyoming
texas main article texas annexation map of mexico in 1845 with the republic of texas the republic of yucatan and the disputed territory between mexico and texas in red mexico claimed to own all of texas upon hearing of polk's election to office tyler urged congress to pass a joint resolution admitting texas to the union congress complied on february 28 1845 texas promptly accepted the offer and officially became a state on december 29 1845 the annexation angered mexico which had lost texas in 1836 mexican politicians had repeatedly warned that annexation would lead to war nonetheless just days after the resolution passed congress polk declared in his inaugural address that only texas and the united states would decide whether to annex
invasion of mexico main article mexican-american war polk's presidential proclamation of war against mexico after the texas annexation polk turned his attention to california hoping to acquire the territory from mexico before any european nation did so the main interest was san francisco bay as an access point for trade with asia in 1845 he sent diplomat john slidell to mexico to purchase california and new mexico for $24�30&#160million slidell's arrival caused political turmoil in mexico after word leaked out that he was there to purchase additional territory and not to offer compensation for the loss of texas the mexicans refused to receive slidell citing a technical problem with his credentials in january 1846 to increase pressure on mexico to negotiate polk sent troops under general zachary taylor into the area between the nueces river and the rio grande�territory that was claimed by both the us and mexico
slidell returned to washington in may 1846 having been rebuffed by the mexican government polk regarded this treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an ample cause of war[52] and he prepared to ask congress for a declaration of war meanwhile taylor crossed the rio grande and briefly occupied matamoros tamaulipas taylor continued to blockade ships from entering the port of matamoros mere days before polk intended to make his request to congress he received word that mexican forces had crossed the rio grande area and killed eleven american soldiers polk then made this the casus belli and in a message to congress on may 11 1846 he stated that mexico had invaded our territory and shed american blood upon the american soil
some whigs such as abraham lincoln challenged polk's version of events[53] but congress overwhelmingly approved the declaration of war many whigs feared that opposition would cost them politically by casting themselves as unpatriotic for not supporting the war effort[54]
in the house antislavery whigs led by john quincy adams voted against the war among democrats senator john c calhoun was the most notable opponent of the declaration
military action polk selected the top generals and set the military strategy of the war by the summer of 1846 american forces under general stephen w kearny had captured new mexico meanwhile army captain john c fr�mont led settlers in northern california to overthrow the mexican garrison in sonoma (in the bear flag revolt) general zachary taylor at the same time was having success on the rio grande although polk did not reinforce his troops there the united states also negotiated a secret arrangement with antonio l�pez de santa anna the mexican general and dictator who had been overthrown in 1844 santa anna agreed that if given safe passage into mexico he would attempt to persuade those in power to sell california and new mexico to the united states once he reached mexico however he reneged on his agreement declared himself president and tried to drive the american invaders back santa anna's efforts however were in vain as generals taylor and winfield scott destroyed all resistance scott captured mexico city in september 1847 and taylor won a series of victories in northern mexico even after these battles mexico did not surrender until 1848 when it agreed to peace terms set out by polk
peace the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo the mexican cession (in red) was acquired through the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo the gadsden purchase (in orange) was acquired through purchase after polk left office polk sent diplomat nicholas trist to negotiate with the mexicans lack of progress prompted the president to order trist to return to the united states but the diplomat ignored the instructions and stayed in mexico to continue bargaining trist successfully negotiated the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 which polk agreed to ratify ignoring calls from democrats who demanded that all mexico be annexed the treaty added 12&#160million square miles (31&#160million square kilometers) of territory to the united states mexico's size was halved while that of the united states increased by a third california nevada utah most of arizona and parts of new mexico colorado and wyoming were all included in the mexican cession the treaty also recognized the annexation of texas and acknowledged american control over the disputed territory between the nueces river and the rio grande mexico in turn received $15&#160million the war claimed fewer than 20000 american lives but over 50000 mexican ones[55] it may have cost the united states $100&#160million[56] finally the wilmot proviso injected the issue of slavery in the new territories even though polk had insisted to congress and in his diary that this had never been a war goal
the treaty however needed ratification by the senate in march 1848 the whigs who had been so opposed to polk's policy suddenly changed position two-thirds of the whigs voted for polk's treaty this ended the war and legalized the acquisition of the territories
the war had serious consequences for polk and the democrats it gave the whig party a unifying message of denouncing the war as an immoral act of aggression carried out through abuse of power by the president in the 1848 election however the whigs nominated general zachary taylor a war hero and celebrated his victories taylor refused to criticize polk as a result of the strain of managing the war effort directly and in close detail polk's health markedly declined toward the end of his presidency
cuba in mid-1848 president polk authorized his ambassador to spain romulus mitchell saunders to negotiate the purchase of cuba and offer spain up to $100&#160million an astounding sum at the time for one territory equal to $273&#160billion in present-day terms[57] cuba was close to the united states and had slavery so the idea appealed to southerners but was unwelcome in the north however spain was still making huge profits in cuba (notably in sugar molasses rum and tobacco) and thus the spanish government rejected saunders' overtures[58]
department of the interior one of polk's last acts as president was to sign the bill creating the department of the interior (march 3 1849) this was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the republic polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states however the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto or to draft a sufficient veto message so polk signed the bill[59]

polk had the shortest retirement of all presidents at 103 days he was the youngest former president to die in retirement at the age of 53 along with george washington andrew johnson chester a arthur calvin coolidge and lyndon b johnson he is one of six presidents to have died while his direct successor was in office he and his wife are buried in a tomb on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol in nashville tennessee the tomb was moved to this location from their downtown nashville mansion polk place in 1893
reputation a statue of james knox polk at the north carolina state capitol polk statue at university of north carolina at chapel hill see also mexican-american war � opposition to the war polk's historic reputation was largely formed by the attacks made on him in his own time the whigs claimed that he was drawn from a well-deserved obscurity senator tom corwin of ohio remarked james k polk of tennessee after that who is safe the republican historians of the nineteenth century inherited this view polk was a compromise between the democrats of the north like david wilmot and silas wright and the plantation owners who were led by john c calhoun the northern democrats thought that when they did not get their way it was because he was the tool of the slaveholders and the conservatives of the south insisted that he was the tool of the northern democrats these views were long reflected in the historical literature until arthur m schlesinger jr and bernard de voto argued that polk was nobody's tool but set his own goals and achieved them[66]
polk is now recognized not only as the strongest president between jackson and lincoln but the president who made the united states a coast-to-coast nation when historians began ranking the presidents in 1948 polk ranked 10th in arthur m schlesinger�s poll and has subsequently ranked 8th in schlesinger�s 1962 poll 11th in the riders-mciver poll (1996) 11th in the most recent siena poll (2002) 9th in the most recent wall street journal poll (2005) and 12th in the latest c-span poll (2009)[67]
polk biographers over the years have sized up the magnitude of polk�s achievements and his legacy particularly his two most recent �there are three key reasons why james k polk deserves recognition as a significant and influential american president� walter borneman wrote �first polk accomplished the objectives of his presidential term as he defined them second he was the most decisive chief executive before the civil war and third he greatly expanded the executive power of the presidency particularly its war powers its role as commander-in-chief and its oversight of the executive branch[68] president harry s truman summarized this view by saying that polk was a great president said what he intended to do and did it[69]
while polk�s legacy thus takes many forms the most outstanding is the map of the continental united states whose landmass he increased by a third �to look at that map� robert merry concluded �and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it is to see the magnitude of polk�s presidential accomplishments�[70]
nevertheless polk's aggressive expansionism has been criticized on ethical grounds he believed in manifest destiny even more than most did referencing the mexican-american war general ulysses s grant stated that i was bitterly opposed to the [texas annexation] and to this day regard the war which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation it was an instance of a republic following the bad example of european monarchies in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory[71] whig politicians including abraham lincoln and john quincy adams contended that the texas annexation and the mexican cession enhanced the pro-slavery factions of the united states[72] unsatisfactory conditions pertaining to the status of slavery in the territories acquired during the polk administration led to the compromise of 1850 one of the primary factors in the establishment of the republican party and later the beginning of the american civil war[73]
humorously sam houston is said to have observed that polk was a victim of the use of water as a beverage[74]
