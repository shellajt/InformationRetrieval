v t e abraham lincoln i/ebrh�m lkn/ (february 12 1809 � april 15 1865) was the 16th president of the united states serving from march 1861 until his assassination in april 1865 lincoln led the united states through its civil war�its bloodiest war and its greatest moral constitutional and political crisis[1][2] in doing so he preserved the union abolished slavery strengthened the federal government and modernized the economy
born in hodgenville kentucky lincoln grew up on the western frontier in kentucky and indiana largely self-educated he became a lawyer in illinois a whig party leader and a member of the illinois house of representatives where he served from 1834 to 1846 elected to the united states house of representatives in 1846 lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks tariffs and railroads because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in congress and because his opposition to the mexican�american war was unpopular among illinois voters lincoln returned to springfield and resumed his successful law practice reentering politics in 1854 he became a leader in building the new republican party which had a statewide majority in illinois in 1858 while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival democrat stephen a douglas lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery but lost the us senate race to douglas
in 1860 lincoln secured the republican party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state with very little support in the slaveholding states of the south he swept the north and was elected president in 1860 his victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the confederate states of america before he moved into the white house - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession subsequently on april 12 1861 a confederate attack on fort sumter inspired the north to enthusiastically rally behind the union in a declaration of war as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party lincoln confronted radical republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the south war democrats who called for more compromise anti-war democrats (called copperheads) who despised him and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his assassination politically lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other by carefully planned political patronage and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory[3] his gettysburg address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism republicanism equal rights liberty and democracy
lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war his primary goal was to reunite the nation he suspended habeas corpus leading to the controversial ex parte merryman decision and he averted potential british intervention in the war by defusing the trent affair in late 1861 lincoln closely supervised the war effort especially the selection of top generals including his most successful general ulysses s grant he also made major decisions on union war strategy including a naval blockade that shut down the south's normal trade moves to take control of kentucky and tennessee and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at richmond each time a general failed lincoln substituted another until finally grant succeeded as the war progressed his complex moves toward ending slavery began with the emancipation proclamation of 1863 subsequently lincoln used the us army to protect escaped slaves encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery and pushed through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution which permanently outlawed slavery
an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state lincoln reached out to the war democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election anticipating the war's conclusion lincoln pushed a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness on april 14 1865 five days after the april 9th surrender of confederate commanding general robert e lee lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth a confederate sympathizer
lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars[4] and the public[5] as one of the three greatest us presidents

family and childhood early life and family ancestry main article early life and career of abraham lincoln abraham lincoln was born february 12 1809 the second child of thomas and nancy hanks lincoln in a one-room log cabin on the sinking spring farm in hardin county kentucky[6] (now larue county) he is a descendant of samuel lincoln who migrated from norfolk england to hingham massachusetts in 1638 samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration which passed through new jersey pennsylvania and virginia[7][8] lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake captain abraham lincoln moved the family from virginia to jefferson county kentucky in the 1780s[9] captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786 his children including six-year-old thomas the future president's father witnessed the attack[10][11] after his father's murder thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier working at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee before settling with members of his family in hardin county kentucky in the early 1800s[12][13]
lincoln's mother nancy was the daughter of lucy shipley hanks and was born in what is now mineral county west virginia then part of virginia the identity of lincoln's maternal grandfather is unclear[14] according to william ensign lincoln's book the ancestry of abraham lincoln nancy was the daughter of joseph hanks[15] however the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock lucy hanks migrated to kentucky with her daughter nancy the two women resided with relatives in washington county kentucky[14][16]
thomas lincoln and nancy hanks were married on june 12 1806 in washington county and moved to elizabethtown kentucky following their marriage[17] they became the parents of three children sarah born on february 10 1807 abraham on february 12 1809 and another son thomas who died in infancy[18] thomas lincoln bought or leased several farms in kentucky including the sinking spring farm where abraham was born however a land title dispute soon forced the lincolns to move[19][20] in 1811 the family relocated eight miles north to knob creek farm where thomas acquired title to 230 acres (93&#160ha) of land in 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm[20] of the 8165 acres that thomas held in kentucky he lost all but 200 acres (81&#160ha) of his land in court disputes over property titles[21] frustrated over the lack of security provided by kentucky courts thomas sold the remaining land he held in kentucky in 1814 and began planning a move to indiana where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure[22]
in 1816 the family moved north across the ohio river to indiana a free non-slaveholding territory where they settled in an unbroken forest[23] in hurricane township perry county (their land in southern indiana became part of spencer county indiana when the county was established in 1818)[24][25] the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial in 1860 lincoln noted that the family's move to indiana was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties in kentucky[21][26] during the family's years in kentucky and indiana thomas lincoln worked as a farmer cabinetmaker and carpenter[27] he owned farms several town lots and livestock paid taxes sat on juries appraised estates served on country slave patrols and guarded prisoners thomas and nancy lincoln were also members of a separate baptists church which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol dancing and slavery[28] within a year of the family's arrival in indiana thomas claimed title to 160 acres (65&#160ha) of indiana land despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to 80 acres (32&#160ha) of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community in spencer county[29] prior to the family's move to illinois in 1830 thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property[30]
the young lincoln in sculpture at senn park chicago several significant family events took place during lincoln's youth in indiana on october 5 1818 nancy lincoln died of milk sickness leaving eleven-year-old sarah in charge of a household that included her father nine-year-old abraham and dennis hanks nancy's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin[31] on december 2 1819 lincoln's father married sarah sally bush johnston a widow from elizabethtown kentucky with three children of her own[32] abraham became very close to his stepmother whom he referred to as mother[33][34] those who knew lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister sarah's death on january 20 1828 while giving birth to a stillborn son[35][36]
as a youth lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his reading scribbling writing ciphering writing poetry etc[37][38][39] and must have done it to avoid manual labor his stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy physical labor but loved to read[40] lincoln was largely self-educated his formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year however he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning[41][42] family neighbors and schoolmates of lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the king james bible aesop's fables bunyan's the pilgrim's progress defoe's robinson crusoe weems's the life of washington and franklin's autobiography among others[43][44][45][46]
as he grew into his teens lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household he also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one[47] abraham became adept at using an axe tall for his age lincoln was also strong and athletic[48] he attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as the clary's grove boys[49]
in early march 1830 fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river the lincoln family moved west to illinois a non-slaveholding state they settled on a site in macon county illinois 10 miles (16&#160km) west of decatur[50][51] historians disagree on who initiated the move[52] after the family relocated to illinois abraham became increasingly distant from his father[53] in part because of his father's lack of education and occasionally lent him money[54] in 1831 as thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county illinois abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own[55] traveling down the sangamon river he ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county[56] later that spring denton offutt a new salem merchant hired lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers after arriving in new orleans�and witnessing slavery firsthand�lincoln returned to new salem where he remained for the next six years[57][58]
marriage and children further information lincoln family tree medical and mental health of abraham lincoln and sexuality of abraham lincoln 1864 photo of president lincoln with youngest son tad mary todd lincoln wife of abraham lincoln age 28 lincoln's first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he first moved to new salem by 1835 they were in a relationship but not formally engaged she died at the age of 22 on august 25 1835 most likely of typhoid fever[59] in the early 1830s he met mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister[60]
late in 1836 lincoln agreed to a match with mary if she returned to new salem mary did return in november 1836 and lincoln courted her for a time however they both had second thoughts about their relationship on august 16 1837 lincoln wrote mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship she never replied and the courtship ended[60]
in 1840 lincoln became engaged to mary todd who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in lexington kentucky[61] they met in springfield illinois in december 1839[62] and were engaged the following december[63] a wedding set for january 1 1841 was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at lincoln's initiative[62][64] they later met again at a party and married on november 4 1842 in the springfield mansion of mary's married sister[65] while preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again lincoln when asked where he was going replied to hell i suppose[66]
in 1844 the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln's law office mary todd lincoln kept house often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl[67] robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln (eddie) in 1846 lincoln was remarkably fond of children[68] and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children[69]
edward died on february 1 1850 in springfield probably of tuberculosis willie lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died of a fever on february 20 1862 the lincolns' fourth son thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16 1871[70] robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children his last descendant great-grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith died in 1985[71]
the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875[72] abraham lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression[73]
lincoln's father-in-law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders lincoln was close to the todds and he and his family occasionally visited the todd estate in lexington[74] he was an affectionate though often absent husband and father of four children
early career and militia service further information early life and career of abraham lincoln and abraham lincoln in the black hawk war lincoln depicted protecting a native american from his own men in a scene often related about lincoln's service during the black hawk war in 1832 at age 23 lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in new salem illinois[75] although the economy was booming in the region the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share that march he began his political career with his first campaign for the illinois general assembly he had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in new salem though he lacked an education powerful friends and money which may be why he lost he advocated navigational improvements on the sangamon river[76][77]
before the election lincoln served as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war[78] following his return lincoln continued his campaign for the august 6 election for the illinois general assembly at 6&#160feet 4&#160inches (193&#160cm)[79] he was tall and strong enough to intimidate any rival at his first speech when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked lincoln grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers and threw him[80] lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected) though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct[81]
lincoln served as new salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor all the while reading voraciously he then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone's commentaries on the laws of england and other law books of his learning method lincoln stated i studied with nobody[82] his second campaign in 1834 was successful he won election to the state legislature though he ran as a whig many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent[83]
admitted to the bar in 1836[84] he moved to springfield illinois and began to practice law under john t stuart mary todd's cousin[85] lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments he partnered with stephen t logan from 1841 until 1844 then lincoln began his practice with william herndon whom lincoln thought a studious young man[86]
successful on his second run for office lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig representative from sangamon county[87] he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal which he remained involved with later as a canal commissioner[88] in the 1835�36 legislative session he voted to expand suffrage to white males whether landowners or not[89] he was known for his free soil stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism he first articulated this in 1837 saying [the] institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils[90] his stance closely followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in liberia in africa[91]
us house of representatives 1847�49 lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the us house of representatives photo taken by one of lincoln's law students around 1846 from the early 1830s lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay[92] the party including lincoln favored economic modernization in banking protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and espoused urbanization as well[93]
in 1846 lincoln was elected to the us house of representatives where he served one two-year term he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line[94] lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r giddings wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters[95]
on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke out against the mexican�american war which he attributed to president polk's desire for military glory�that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood[96] lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso which if it had been adopted would have banned slavery in any us territory won from mexico[97]
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the us polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil[98][99] lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil[99]
congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln[100][101][102] lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers[103]
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency lincoln who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election[104] taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival justin butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in lincoln's view an old fossil[105] the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice[106]
prairie lawyer lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer[107] twice a year for 16 years 10 weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session[108] lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him[109] in fact he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge[110][111] in 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water the idea was never commercialized but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent[112][113]
in 1851 he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route[114][115] lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barret's pledge the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand barret's payment the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation[114] lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor[116] from 1853 to 1860 another of lincoln's largest clients was the illinois central railroad[117] lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname honest abe[118]
lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker[119] the case is famous for lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers' almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted[119]
lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an 1859 case where he defended a cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison[119][120]
republican politics 1854�60 slavery and a house divided further information slave and free states and abraham lincoln and slavery by the 1850s slavery was still legal in the southern united states but had been generally outlawed in the northern states including illinois whose original 1818 constitution forbade slavery as required by the northwest ordinance[121] lincoln disapproved of slavery and the spread of slavery to new us territory in the west[122] he returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery kansas�nebraska act (1854) this law repealed the slavery-restricting missouri compromise (1820) senior senator stephen a douglas of illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the act douglas' provision which lincoln opposed specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new us territory rather than have such a decision restricted by the national congress[123]
eric foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the declaration of independence[124]
a portrait of dred scott lincoln denounced the supreme court decision in dred scott v sandford as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery on october 16 1854 in his peoria speech lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency[125] speaking in his kentucky accent with a very powerful voice[126] he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&#160[127]
in late 1854 lincoln ran as a whig for the us senate seat from illinois at that time senators were elected by the state legislature[128] after leading in the first six rounds of voting in the illinois assembly his support began to dwindle and lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull who defeated opponent joel aldrich matteson[129] the whigs had been irreparably split by the kansas�nebraska act lincoln wrote i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist [] i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery[130]
drawing on remnants of the old whig party and on disenchanted free soil liberty and democratic party members he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new republican party[131] at the 1856 republican national convention lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president[132]
in 1857�1858 douglas broke with president james buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state[133] in march 1857 the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott v sandford chief justice roger b taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power[134] lincoln argued the authors of the declaration of independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity' but they 'did consider all men created equal�equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness'[135]
after the state republican party convention nominated him for the us senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on mark 325 a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved�i do not expect the house to fall�but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other[136] the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north[137] the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its us senator[138]
lincoln�douglas debates and cooper union speech further information lincoln�douglas debates and cooper union speech lincoln in 1858 the year of his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln�douglas debates of 1858 the most famous political debates in american history[139] the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists[140] the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands lincoln stated douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the us supreme court and the dred scott decision[141]
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re-elected douglas to the senate despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation[142] in may 1859 lincoln purchased the illinois staats-anzeiger a german-language newspaper which was consistently supportive most of the state's 130000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german-language paper could mobilize[143]
on february 27 1860 new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong[144] despite his inelegant appearance�many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly[145]�lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience[146][147]
historian donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival's (william h seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (salmon p chase) loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery[148] in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little[149]
1860 presidential nomination and campaign main articles electoral history of abraham lincoln and united states presidential election 1860 the rail candidate�lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue�a slave on the left and party organization on the right on may 9�10 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur[150] lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency[151] exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax) lincoln's supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate[152]
on may 18 at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as william h seward and salmon p chase a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff[153]
on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs[154] lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following lincoln's strong dictate to make no contracts that bind me[155]
most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan throughout the 1850s lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession[156] meanwhile douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the democratic convention disagreeing with douglas' position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected john c breckinridge as their candidate[157]
as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln's life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts[158] the republican party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln's life and sold 100000 to 200000 copies[159]

lincoln received 1866452 votes douglas 1376957 votes breckinridge 849781 votes and bell 588789 votes turnout was 822&#160percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln[161] bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south[162]
although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123 there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the anti-lincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college[163]
the first photographic image of the new president as lincoln's election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march[164] on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february 1 1861 florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed[165][166] six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america[165] the upper south and border states (delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas) listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal[167] president buchanan and president-elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal[168] the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 1861[169]
there were attempts at compromise the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican party's free-soil platform[170] lincoln rejected the idea saying i will suffer death before i consent&#160 to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right[171]
lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent[172][173] a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution[174] lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution[175]
en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north[176] the president-elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincoln's head of security allan pinkerton on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard[177] lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so
�&#160first inaugural address 4 march 1861[178] the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies&#160 the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature[179] the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated[180] lincoln said as the war was ending
both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came[181] beginning of the war the neutrality of this article is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved (january 2015) main articles american civil war and battle of fort sumter major anderson ft sumter commander the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent a request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion[182]
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war[183] donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that[184]
on april 15 lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states this call forced the states to choose sides virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky tried to be neutral[185] the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason-dixon line to the defense of the american nation historian allan nevins says
the thunderclap of sumter produced a startling crystallization of northern sentimentanger swept the land from every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures[186][187] states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion on april 19 mobs in baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington[188] john merryman a maryland official involved in hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander roger b taney author of the controversial pro-slavery dred scott opinion to issue a writ of habeas corpus and in june taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court issued the writ because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling[189][190]
assuming command for the union in the war after the battle of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander-in-chief using unprecedented powers he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict[191]
running the 'machine'&#160 an 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at lincoln's administration�featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery[192] on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy[193]
in late august 1861 general john c fr�mont the 1856 republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in washington a proclamation of martial law in missouri he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed fr�mont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption lincoln overruled fr�mont's proclamation lincoln believed that fremont's emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal[194] after lincoln acted union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40000 troops[195]
the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain the us navy illegally intercepted a british merchant ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with britain[196] lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off due to his inexperience he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his secretary of state william seward seward's initial reaction to the trent affair however was too bellicose so lincoln also turned to senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and an expert in british diplomacy[197]
to learn technical military terms lincoln borrowed and studied henry halleck's book elements of military art and science from the library of congress[198] lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department in washington dc he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party) in january 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary stanton was a staunchly unionist pro-business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman[199]
in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was well-defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days[200] twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard[201] lincoln learned from his chief of staff general henry halleck a student of the european strategist jomini of the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river[202] he also knew well the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army rather than simply capturing territory[203]
general mcclellan after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 1861 lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan general-in-chief of all the union armies[204] mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted the campaign's objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital mcclellan's repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan's troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign[205]
lincoln and george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in 1862 lincoln removed mcclellan as general-in-chief and appointed henry wager halleck in march 1862 after mcclellan's harrison's landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort[206] mcclellan's letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincoln's strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack[207]
however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time[207] the war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads[208]
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan's failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward[209] two days after mcclellan's return to command general robert e lee's forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september 1862[210] the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation[211]
mcclellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue lee's retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander-in-chief[212]
union soldiers before marye's heights fredericksburg just prior to the battle of may 3 1863 burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg[213] lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship[214]
the mid-term elections in 1862 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest[215]
while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress[215]
in the spring of 1863 lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included hooker's attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans' on chattanooga grant's on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston[216]
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may[217] but continued to command his troops for some weeks he ignored lincoln's order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper's ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lee's army avoided capture at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor[218] after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander-in-chief[219]
emancipation proclamation main articles abraham lincoln and slavery and emancipation proclamation lincoln presents the first draft of the emancipation proclamation to his cabinet painted by francis bicknell carpenter in 1864 lincoln understood that the federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new us territory at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution[220] president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c fr�mont in august 1861 and by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union[221]
on june 19 1862 endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory in july 1862 the second confiscation act was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion although lincoln believed it was not within congress's power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature he felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet in it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on january 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free[222]
privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy[223] and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22 1862 although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the us president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty) was that of preserving the union[224]
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union&#160 [�] i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free[225]
the emancipation proclamation issued on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states[226] lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites[227]
once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed lincoln's comment on the signing of the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper[228] for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed[229] a few days after emancipation was announced 13 republican governors met at the war governors' conference they supported the president's proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union army[230]
enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation by the spring of 1863 lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once[231] by the end of 1863 at lincoln's direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley[232] frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color[233]
gettysburg address (1863) main article gettysburg address the only confirmed photo of abraham lincoln at gettysburg some three hours before the speech with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 1863[234] defying lincoln's prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history[235]
in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation[236][237]
general grant president lincoln (center right) with from left generals sherman and grant and admiral porter � 1868 painting of events aboard the river queen in march 1865 meade's failure to capture lee's army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed general ulysses s grant's victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i can't spare this man he fights[238] with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops[239]
nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864 as mcclellan was lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant's political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant's promotion to commander of the union army he obtained congress's consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington[240]
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces[241] the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grant's plans were to which the general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer[242]
the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee's army shrank with every costly battle grant's army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia lincoln then made an extended visit to grant's headquarters at city point virginia this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina[243] lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses[244]
lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure�such as plantations railroads and bridges�hoping to destroy the south's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting grant's move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia's shenandoah valley the damage caused by sherman's march to the sea through georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60-mile (97&#160km) swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies mark e neely jr has argued that there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii[245][vague]
confederate general jubal anderson early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital during early's raid on washington dc in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot[246] after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched[247]
as grant continued to wear down lee's forces efforts to discuss peace began confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results[248] on april 1 1865 grant successfully outflanked lee's forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stone-faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over[249]

when grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president's re-election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house[253]
this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re-elected then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward[254]
lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope
an electoral landslide (in red) for lincoln in the 1864 election southern states (brown) and territories (light brown) not in play lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed capitol building while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort sherman's capture of atlanta in september and david farragut's capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters[255] the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads[256] on november 8 lincoln was re-elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the union soldiers' vote[253][257]
on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god's will historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world[258] lincoln said
fondly do we hope�fervently do we pray�that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said 3000 years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan�to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations[259]
reconstruction main article reconstruction era reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves shortly after lee's surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let 'em up easy[260] in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance[261]

lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness to fill chief justice taney's seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies[263]
after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter[264] by december 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 15 1864 in the house of representatives passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican/unionist platform in the election of 1864 after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification[265][266] upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865[267]
as the war drew to a close lincoln's presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen he signed into law senator charles sumner's freedmen's bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists[268]
historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen lincoln biographers james g randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that
it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson's that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson's mistakes[269] eric foner argues that
unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land he believed as most republicans did in april 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forward-looking former confederates but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death[270] redefining the republic and republicanism lincoln in february 1865 about two months before his death the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural (these united states) and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century[271]
in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln's redefinition of republican values as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values�what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism[272] the declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery shifted the debate as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860 lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself[273] his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms[274] nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree) and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state[275] burton (2008) argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated[276]
in march 1861 in lincoln's first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people[277]
other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction[278] he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of government-held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill land-grant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states' first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869[279] the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s[280]

lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country it also established a national currency in 1862 congress created with lincoln's approval the department of agriculture[284] in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved)[285] president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy[286]
in the wake of grant's casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers the seizure lasted for two days[287]
lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states[288] before lincoln's presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates the last such proclamation had been during james madison's presidency 50 years before in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving[288] in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park[289]
