primary and secondary education young richard attended east whittier elementary school where he was president of his eighth-grade class[11] his parents believed that attendance at whittier high school had caused richard's older brother harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933) instead they sent richard to the larger fullerton union high school[12][13] he received excellent grades even though he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year�later he lived with an aunt in fullerton during the week[14] he played junior varsity football and seldom missed a practice even though he was rarely used in games[15] he had greater success as a debater winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from fullerton's head of english h lynn sheller nixon later remembered sheller's words remember speaking is conversation&#160 don't shout at people talk to them converse with them[16] nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible[16]

collegiate and law school education nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend harvard university but harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant richard was needed at the store he remained in his hometown and attended whittier college his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather[18] nixon played for the basketball team he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play he remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm[19] instead of fraternities and sororities whittier had literary societies nixon was snubbed by the only one for men the franklins many members of the franklins were from prominent families but nixon was not he responded by helping to found a new society the orthogonian society[20] in addition to the society schoolwork and work at the store nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker[21] in 1933 he became engaged to ola florence welch daughter of the whittier police chief the two broke up in 1935[22]

in the senate nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat[63] he maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist the controversial wisconsin senator joseph mccarthy but was careful to keep some distance between himself and mccarthy's allegations[64] nixon also criticized president harry s truman's handling of the korean war[63] he supported statehood for alaska and hawaii voted in favor of civil rights for minorities and supported federal disaster relief for india and yugoslavia[65] he voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions benefits for illegal immigrants and public power[65]
vice presidency a piece of literature for the eisenhower�nixon campaign 1952 general dwight d eisenhower was nominated for president by the republicans in 1952 he had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate and republican officeholders and party officials met in a smoke-filled room and recommended nixon to the general who agreed to the senator's selection nixon's youth (he was then 39) stance against communism and political base in california�one of the largest states�were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders among the candidates considered along with nixon were ohio senator robert a taft new jersey governor alfred driscoll and illinois senator everett dirksen[66][67] on the campaign trail eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate[68]
in mid-september the republican ticket faced a major crisis[69] the media reported that nixon had a political fund maintained by his backers which reimbursed him for political expenses[70] such a fund was not illegal but it exposed nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest with pressure building for eisenhower to demand nixon's resignation from the ticket the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on september 23 1952[71] the address later termed the checkers speech was heard by about 60 million americans�including the largest television audience up to that point[72] nixon emotionally defended himself stating that the fund was not secret nor had donors received special favors he painted himself as a man of modest means (his wife had no mink coat instead she wore a respectable republican cloth coat) and a patriot[71] the speech would be remembered for the gift which nixon had received but which he would not give back a little cocker spaniel dog  sent all the way from texas and our little girl�tricia the 6-year-old�named it checkers[71] the speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for nixon[73] eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket[74] which proved victorious in the november election[68]

eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office the vice president welcomed the president's initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish white house objectives because of the collaboration between these two leaders nixon deserves the title the first modern vice president[78]
despite intense campaigning by nixon who reprised his strong attacks on the democrats the republicans lost control of both houses of congress in the 1954 elections these losses caused nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term[79] on september 24 1955 president eisenhower suffered a heart attack his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks the 25th amendment to the united states constitution had not yet been proposed and the vice president had no formal power to act nonetheless nixon acted in eisenhower's stead during this period presiding over cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and cabinet officers did not seek power[80] according to nixon biographer stephen ambrose nixon had earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis&#160 he made no attempt to seize power[81]
his spirits buoyed nixon sought a second term but some of eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him in a december 1955 meeting eisenhower proposed that nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a cabinet officer in a second eisenhower administration nixon however believed such an action would destroy his political career when eisenhower announced his reelection bid in february 1956 he hedged on the choice of his running mate stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated although no republican was opposing eisenhower nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the president in the 1956 new hampshire primary election in late april the president announced that nixon would again be his running mate[82] eisenhower and nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the november 1956 election[83]

president nixon greets chinese communist party chairman mao zedong (left) in a historic visit to the people's republic of china 1972 nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at mao's official private residence where they discussed a range of issues[126] mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets[126] he said he was suspicious of kissinger[126] though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history[125] a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou the joint communique following this meeting recognized taiwan as a part of china and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification[127] when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall[125] americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals[125]
the visit ushered in a new era of sino-american relations[109] fearing the possibility of a sino-american alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for d�tente with the united states[128]
vietnam war main articles vietnam war and role of the united states in the vietnam war when nixon took office about 300 american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam[129] and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with violent protests against the war ongoing the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly[130] conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory[131] nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack[132]
nixon delivers an address to the nation about the cambodian incursion nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of north vietnamese and allied khmer rouge positions in cambodia in march 1969 (code-named operation menu)[133] a policy begun under johnson[134] these operations resulted in heavy bombing of cambodia by one measurement more bombs were dropped over cambodia under johnson and nixon than the allies dropped during world war ii[134] in mid-1969 nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement[135] in may 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all american troops from south vietnam provided north vietnam also did so and for south vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with viet cong participation[136]
in july 1969 nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyen van thieu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization[109] he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals[137] but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april 30 1970[138] his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may 9 1970[139][140][141] documents uncovered from the soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pot's then second in command nuon chea[142] nixon's campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue[137]
in 1971 excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states' involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers[143]
as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended the armed forces became all-volunteer[144] after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of 1973 the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the 160000 north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw[145] once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in 1975[146]
latin american policy nixon and mexican president gustavo d�az ordaz riding a presidential motorcade in san diego california september 1970 nixon had been a firm supporter of kennedy in the 1961 bay of pigs invasion and 1962 cuban missile crisis on taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cuban-american exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba and break the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august 1970 the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the understanding despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process had not yet been completed when the soviets began expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october 1970 a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the 1962 accord were exchanged in november[147]
the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september 1970 spurred nixon and kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to allende[148]25 first designed to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup[148] other support included strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents it was even alleged that nixon personally authorized $700000 in covert funds to print anti-allende messages in a prominent chilean newspaper[148]93 following an extended period of social political and economic unrest general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d'�tat on september 11 1973 among the dead was allende[149]

seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily[151][152][153] nixon later described his strategy
i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and d�tente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept[154]
having made considerable progress over the previous two years in us-soviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in 1974[155] he arrived in moscow on june 27 to a welcome ceremony cheering crowds and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening[155] nixon and brezhnev met in yalta where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact d�tente and mirvs while he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it[155] there were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations[155]
middle eastern policy 
nixon meets with president anwar sadat of egypt june 1974 as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east�particularly israel iran and saudi arabia�during the nixon administration[156] the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that�except during the suez crisis�the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arab-israeli conflict was not a major focus of nixon's attention during his first term�for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection[a]
on october 6 1973 an arab coalition led by egypt and syria supported with tons of arms and materiel by the soviet union attacked israel in what was known as the yom kippur war israel suffered heavy losses and nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations more than a week later by the time the us and soviet union began negotiating a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory the truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis when israel gained the upper-hand egyptian president sadat requested a joint us-ussr peacekeeping mission which the us refused when soviet premier brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily nixon ordered the us military to defcon3[157] placing all us military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war this was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the cuban missile crisis brezhnev backed down as a result of nixon's actions[158]
because israel's victory was largely due to us support the arab opec nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the us resulting in the 1973 oil crisis[159] the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late 1973 and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the middle east took hold[160]
after the war and under nixon's presidency the us reestablished relations with egypt for the first time since 1967 nixon used the middle east crisis to restart the stalled middle east peace negotiations he wrote in a confidential memo to kissinger on october 20
i believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the middle east i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by i now consider a permanent middle east settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves[161]
nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the middle east in june 1974 and became the first president to visit israel[162]
domestic policy at the washington senators' 1969 opening day at rfk stadium to nixon's left is team owner bob short baseball commissioner bowie kuhn is on the left side of short marine corps aide to the president colonel jack brennan sits behind nixon to his left economy further information nixon shock and 1970s energy crisis at the time nixon took office in 1969 inflation was at 47&#160percent�its highest rate since the korean war the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits unemployment was low but interest rates were at their highest in a century[163] nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war[163] this could not be accomplished overnight and the us economy continued to struggle through 1970 contributing to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixon's presidency)[164] according to political economist nigel bowles in his 2011 study of nixon's economic record the new president did little to alter johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency[165]
nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection as part of his new federalism views he proposed grants to the states but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process however nixon gained political credit for advocating them[164] in 1970 congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes though the democratic majorities knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority[165] with inflation unresolved by august 1971 and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold[166] bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents&#160 to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself[165] nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972 although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration[166]
after he won reelection nixon found inflation returning[167] he reimposed price controls in june 1973 the price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy[167] the controls produced food shortages as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss[167] despite the failure to control inflation controls were slowly ended and on april 30 1974 their statutory authorization lapsed[167]
governmental initiatives and organization nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them[168] he eliminated the cabinet-level united states post office department which in 1971 became the government-run united states postal service[169]
nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency (epa) nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speech other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of 1970 and occupational safety and health administration (osha) the national environmental policy act required environmental impact statements for many federal projects[170] nixon vetoed the clean water act of 1972�objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them which he deemed excessive after congress overrode his veto nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable[171]
in 1971 nixon proposed health insurance reform�a private health insurance employer mandate[b] federalization of medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children[172] and support for health maintenance organizations (hmos)[173] a limited hmo bill was enacted in 1973[173] in 1974 nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform�a private health insurance employer mandate[b] and replacement of medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing[174]
concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among american soldiers in vietnam nixon called for a war on drugs pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities[175]
as one policy initiative nixon called for more money for sickle cell research treatment and education in february 1971[176] and signed the national sickle cell anemia control act on may 16 1972[177][178][c] while nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as cancer and sickle cell at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the national institutes of health[179]
civil rights the nixon years witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the south[180] nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites[181] hopeful of doing well in the south in 1972 he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then soon after his inauguration he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders�both white and black�to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september 1970 less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by 1971 however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use[182]
in addition to desegregating public schools nixon implemented the philadelphia plan in 1970�the first significant federal affirmative action program[183] he also endorsed the equal rights amendment after it passed both houses of congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification[184] nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in 1968 though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had[185]
space policy nixon visits the apollo 11 astronauts in quarantine aboard uss hornet further information space policy of the united states after a nearly decade-long national effort the united states won the race to land astronauts on the moon on july 20 1969 with the flight of apollo 11 nixon spoke with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin during their moonwalk he called the conversation the most historic phone call ever made from the white house[186]
nixon however was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) at the high level seen through the 1960s as nasa prepared to send men to the moon nasa administrator thomas o paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as 1981 nixon however rejected both proposals due to the expense[187] nixon also canceled the air force manned orbital laboratory program in 1969 because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective[188]
on march 7 1970 nixon announced the end of the kennedy-johnson era's massive efforts in the space race stating we must think of [space activities] as part of a continuing process and not as a series of separate leaps each requiring a massive concentration of energy space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities what we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us he then cancelled the last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the space shuttle[189]
on may 24 1972 nixon approved a five-year cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space[190]

nixon meets the public during the 1972 presidential campaign nixon entered his name on the new hampshire primary ballot on january 5 1972 effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection[192] virtually assured the republican nomination[193] the president had initially expected his democratic opponent to be massachusetts senator ted kennedy (brother of the late president) but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 chappaquiddick incident[194] instead maine senator edmund muskie became the front runner with south dakota senator george mcgovern in a close second place[192]
on june 10 mcgovern won the california primary and secured the democratic nomination[195] the following month nixon was renominated at the 1972 republican national convention he dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive[196] mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[197] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate missouri senator thomas eagleton dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression[198][199] nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle and was reelected on november 7 1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history he defeated mcgovern with over 60&#160percent of the popular vote losing only in massachusetts and the district of columbia[200]

people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well i'm not a crook i've earned everything i've got[207]
the legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974 and in april 1974 nixon announced the release of 1200 pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may 9 1974 which were televised on the major tv networks these hearings culminated in votes for impeachment[204] on july 24 the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released[208]
the scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the president ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due and paid $465000 in back taxes in 1974[209]
even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to fight the charges however one of the new tapes recorded soon after the break-in demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the smoking gun tape on august 5 1974 nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of white house involvement stating that he had a lapse of memory[210] he met with republican congressional leaders soon after and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most only 15 votes in his favor in the senate� far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office[211]

sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly[213]

i was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with watergate particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy no words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over watergate have caused the nation and the presidency a nation i so deeply love and an institution i so greatly respect[219][220]

so be it we will see it through we've had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now that is perhaps what we were made for�to be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office this is a test of character and we must not fail the test[224]
nixon (right) joins gerald ford (center) and president jimmy carter (left) at the white house for the funeral of former vice president hubert humphrey 1978 by early 1975 nixon's health was improving he maintained an office in a coast guard station 300 yards from his home at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day he mainly worked on his memoirs[225] he had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly[226] he was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in february which compelled him to part with much of his staff including ziegler[227] in august of that year he met with british talk-show host and producer david frost who paid him $600000 for a series of sit-down interviews filmed and aired in 1977[228] they began on the topic of foreign policy recounting the leaders he had known but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on watergate nixon admitted that he had let down the country and that i brought myself down i gave them a sword and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish and i guess if i'd been in their position i'd have done the same thing[229] the interviews garnered 45�50&#160million viewers�becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history[230]
the interviews helped improve nixon's financial position�at one point in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank�as did the sale of his key biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy nixon friends such as bebe rebozo[231] in february 1976 nixon visited china at the personal invitation of mao nixon had wanted to return to china but chose to wait until after ford's own visit in 1975[232] nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between ford and reagan ford won but was defeated by georgia governor jimmy carter in the general election the carter administration had little use for nixon and blocked his planned trip to australia causing the government of prime minister malcolm fraser to withhold its official invitation[233]
in 1976 nixon was disbarred in the state of new york for obstruction of justice in the watergate affair nixon chose not to present any defense[234] in early 1978 nixon went to the united kingdom he was shunned by american diplomats and by most ministers of the james callaghan government he was welcomed however by the leader of the opposition margaret thatcher as well as by former prime ministers lord home and sir harold wilson two other former prime ministers harold macmillan and edward heath declined to meet him nixon addressed the oxford union regarding watergate

nixon visits president bill clinton in the white house family quarters march 1993 in 1986 nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers impressing his audience with his tour d'horizon of the world[245] at the time political pundit elizabeth drew wrote even when he was wrong nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times[245] newsweek ran a story on nixon's comeback with the headline he's back[246]

richard nixon is buried beside his wife pat on the grounds of the nixon library he was survived by his two daughters tricia and julie and four grandchildren[250] in keeping with his wishes his funeral was not a full state funeral though his body did lie in repose in the nixon library lobby from april 26 to the morning of the funeral service[252] mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly wet weather to pay their respects[253] at its peak the line to pass by nixon's casket was three miles long with an estimated 42000 people waiting to pay their respects[254]
john f stacks of time magazine said of nixon shortly after his death an outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self-created disaster that he faced to reclaim a respected place in american public life after his resignation he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world's leaders&#160 and by the time bill clinton came to the white house [in 1993] nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman clinton whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach nixon met openly with him and regularly sought his advice[255] tom wicker of the new york times noted that nixon had been equalled only by franklin roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and quoting nixon's 1962 farewell speech wrote richard nixon's jowly beard-shadowed face the ski-jump nose and the widow's peak the arms upstretched in the v-sign had been so often pictured and caricatured his presence had become such a familiar one in the land he had been so often in the heat of controversy that it was hard to realize the nation really would not 'have nixon to kick around anymore'[256] ambrose said of the reaction to nixon's death to everyone's amazement except his he's our beloved elder statesman[257]
upon nixon's death almost all of the news coverage mentioned watergate but for the most part the coverage was favorable to the former president the dallas morning news stated history ultimately should show that despite his flaws he was one of our most farsighted chief executives[258] this offended some columnist russell baker complained of a group conspiracy to grant him absolution[259] cartoonist jeff koterba of the omaha world-herald depicted history before a blank canvas his subject nixon as america looks on eagerly the artist urges his audience to sit down the work will take some time to complete as this portrait is a little more complicated than most[260]
legacy historian and political scientist james macgregor burns observed of nixon how can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president so brilliant and so morally lacking[261] nixon's biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history according to ambrose nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished what he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation[262] irwin gellman who chronicled nixon's congressional career suggests that he was remarkable among his congressional peers a success story in a troubled era one who steered a sensible anti-communist course against the excess of mccarthy[263] aitken feels that nixon both as a man and as a statesman has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism no simple verdict is possible[264]
the graves of president richard nixon (right) and first lady pat nixon nixon's southern strategy is credited by some historians as causing the south to become a republican stronghold though others deem economic factors more important to the change[191] throughout his career he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing soviet communism[265] according to his biographer herbert parmet nixon's role was to steer the republican party along a middle course somewhere between the competitive impulses of the rockefellers the goldwaters and the reagans[266]
nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation historian paul charles milazzo in his 2011 paper on nixon and the environment points to nixon's creation of the epa and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 endangered species act stating that though unsought and unacknowledged richard nixon's environmental legacy is secure[267]
nixon saw his policies regarding vietnam china and the soviets as key to his place in history[156] george mcgovern nixon's onetime opponent commented in 1983 president nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers china and the soviet union than any other president since world war ii&#160 with the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in vietnam nixon really will get high marks in history[268] political scientist jussi m hanhim�ki disagrees saying nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the cold war policy of containment using diplomatic rather than military means[156]
historian keith w olson has written that nixon left a negative legacy fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in vietnam and watergate[269] during the impeachment of bill clinton in 1998 both sides tried to use nixon and watergate to their advantage republicans suggested that clinton's misconduct had been comparable to nixon's while democrats contended that nixon's actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent[270] another legacy for a time was a decrease in the power of the presidency as congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of watergate olson suggests that grants of power to george w bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power[269]
personality and public image nixon and elvis presley in december 1970 the president & the king nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred he was often portrayed with unshaven jowls slumped shoulders and a furrowed sweaty brow[271]
nixon had a complex personality both very secretive and awkward yet strikingly reflective about himself he was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects wearing a coat and tie even when home alone[272] nixon biographer conrad black described him as being driven though also uneasy with himself in some ways[273] according to black nixon thought that he was doomed to be traduced double-crossed unjustly harassed misunderstood underappreciated and subjected to the trials of job but that by the application of his mighty will tenacity and diligence he would ultimately prevail[274] biographer elizabeth drew summarized nixon as a smart talented man but most peculiar and haunted of presidents[275] in his account of the nixon presidency author richard reeves described nixon as a strange man of uncomfortable shyness who functioned best alone with his thoughts[276] nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality reeves argues he assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them&#160 he clung to the idea of being 'tough' he thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness but that was what betrayed him he could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness[277]
nixon with bebe rebozo (left) and fbi director j edgar hoover the three men relax before dinner key biscayne florida december 1971 nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president even bebe rebozo by some accounts his closest friend did not call him by his first name nixon stated of this even with close friends i don't believe in letting your hair down confiding this and that and the other thing�saying 'gee i couldn't sleep'&#160 i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself that's just the way i am some people are different some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and you know just spill your guts&#160 [and] reveal their inner psyche�whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed not me no way[278] when told that most americans even at the end of his career did not feel they knew him nixon replied yeah it's true and it's not necessary for them to know[278]
