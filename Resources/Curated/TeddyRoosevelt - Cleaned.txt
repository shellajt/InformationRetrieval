v t e theodore roosevelt (/rozvlt/ roh-z-velt[a] october 27 1858 � january 6 1919) often referred to as teddy or tr was an american statesman author explorer soldier naturalist and reformer who served as the 26th president of the united states from 1901 to 1909 a leader of the republican party he was a leading force of the progressive era born a sickly child with debilitating asthma roosevelt embraced a strenuous lifestyle and successfully regained his health he integrated his exuberant personality vast range of interests and world-famous achievements into a cowboy persona defined by robust masculinity home-schooled he became a lifelong naturalist before attending harvard college his first of many books the naval war of 1812 (1882) established his reputation as both a learned historian and a popular writer he entered politics becoming the leader of the reform faction of republicans in new york's state legislature following the deaths of his wife and mother he escaped to the wilderness and operated a cattle ranch in the dakotas he returned to run unsuccessfully for mayor of new york city in 1886 he served as assistant secretary of the navy under william mckinley resigning after one year to serve with the rough riders gaining national fame for courage during the war in cuba returning a war hero he was elected governor of new york in 1898 a frustrated party establishment made him mckinley's running mate in the election of 1900 he campaigned vigorously across the country helping mckinley win reelection by a landslide on a platform of peace prosperity and conservatism
the assassination of president mckinley in september 1901 meant that at age 42 roosevelt had become president of the united states the youngest in history leading his party and country into the progressive era he championed his square deal domestic policies promising the average citizen fairness breaking of trusts regulation of railroads and pure food and drugs making conservation a top priority he established myriad new national parks forests and monuments in order to preserve the nation's natural resources in foreign policy he concentrated on central america where he began construction of the panama canal he also greatly expanded the united states navy and sent the great white fleet on a world tour to project the united states' naval power his successful efforts to end the russo-japanese war won him the 1906 nobel peace prize
elected in 1904 to a full term he continued pursuit of progressive policies eventually culminating in blockage of his legislative agenda in congress roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend william howard taft for the presidency after leaving office he went on safari in africa and toured europe returning to the usa he became frustrated with taft's approach as his successor trying but failing to win the nomination in 1912 he founded his own party the progressive bull moose party and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms the split allowed the democrats to win the white house and congress in 1912 those republicans aligned with taft would control the republican party for decades
frustrated at home roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the amazon nearly dying of tropical disease during world war i he opposed president wilson for keeping the us out of the war against germany and offered his military services which were never summoned although he planned to run again for president in 1920 his health quickly deteriorated and he died in early 1919 roosevelt has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest us presidents[2] his face adorns mount rushmore alongside those of washington jefferson and lincoln

early life and family theodore roosevelt at age 11 roosevelt's coat of arms featuring a rose bush in reference to the name roosevelt comes from the dutch for rose field[3] theodore roosevelt was born on october 27 1858 in a four-story brownstone at 28 east 20th street in manhattan new york he was the second of four children born to socialite martha stewart mittie bulloch and glass businessman and philanthropist theodore roosevelt sr he had an older sister anna (nicknamed bamie) a younger brother elliott and a younger sister corinne elliott was the father of first lady anna eleanor roosevelt the wife of president franklin delano roosevelt his paternal grandfather was of dutch descent[4] his other ancestry included english scots-irish[5] scottish welsh french and german[6] thee (theodore roosevelt sr) was the fifth son of businessman cornelius van schaack cvs roosevelt and margaret barnhill thee's fourth cousin james roosevelt i who was also a businessman was the father of president franklin delano roosevelt mittie was the younger daughter of major james stephens bulloch and martha p patsy stewart[7] through the van schaacks roosevelt is a descendant of the schuyler family[8]
roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma he repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death which terrified both theodore and his parents doctors had no cure[9] nevertheless he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive[10] his lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market after obtaining the seal's head roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the roosevelt museum of natural history having learned the rudiments of taxidermy he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught he then studied the animals and prepared them for display at age nine he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled the natural history of insects[11]
roosevelt's father significantly influenced him his father had been a prominent leader in new york's cultural affairs he helped to found the metropolitan museum of art and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the union war effort roosevelt wrote my father theodore roosevelt was the best man i ever knew he combined strength and courage with gentleness tenderness and great unselfishness he would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty idleness cowardice or untruthfulness family trips abroad including tours of europe in 1869 and 1870 and egypt in 1872 also had a lasting impact[12] hiking with his family in the alps in 1869 roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father he had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits[13][14] with encouragement from his father roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise after being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his weakened body[15][16]
roosevelt later articulated the abiding influence of the courageous men he read about including those in his family i was nervous and timid yet from reading of the people i admired�ranging from the soldiers of valley forge and morgan's riflemen to the heroes of my favorite stories�and from hearing of the feats of my southern forefathers and kinsfolk and from knowing my father i felt a great admiration for men who were fearless and who could hold their own in the world and i had a great desire to be like them[17]
education roosevelt's taxidermy kit[18] roosevelt was mostly home schooled by tutors and his parents biographer h w brands argues that the most obvious drawback to the home schooling roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge[19] he was solid in geography (as a result of self study during travels) and bright in history biology french and german however he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages he entered harvard college on september 27 1876 his father told him take care of your morals first your health next and finally your studies[20]
after recovering from devastation over his father's death on february 9 1878 roosevelt doubled his activities he did well in science philosophy and rhetoric courses but continued to struggle in latin and greek he studied biology intently and was already an accomplished naturalist and a published ornithologist he read prodigiously with an almost photographic memory[21] while at harvard roosevelt participated in rowing and boxing he was once runner-up in a harvard boxing tournament roosevelt was a member of the alpha delta phi literary society the delta kappa epsilon fraternity and the porcellian club he was also an editor of the harvard advocate on june 30 1880 roosevelt graduated phi beta kappa (22nd of 177) from harvard with an ab magna cum laude[20]
he entered columbia law school and was an able student but he often found law to be irrational he spent much of his time writing a book on the war of 1812 roosevelt eventually became entirely disenchanted with law and diverted his attention to politics at morton hall on 59th street the headquarters for new york's 21st district republican association when the members of the association encouraged him to run for public office he dropped out of law school to do so later saying i intended to be one of the governing class[22]
the naval war of 1812 while at harvard roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the nascent us navy in the war of 1812 largely completing two chapters of a book he published after graduation[23][24] assisted by two uncles he scrutinized original source materials and official us navy records roosevelt's carefully researched book published in 1882 was comparable to modern doctoral dissertations complete with drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between american and british forces and analyses of the differences between english and american leadership down to the ship-to-ship level published after roosevelt's graduation from harvard the naval war of 1812 was praised for its scholarship and style and it showed roosevelt to be a scholar of history one modern naval historian wrote roosevelt's study of the war of 1812 influenced all subsequent scholarship on the naval aspects of the war of 1812 and continues to be reprinted more than a classic it remains after 120 years a standard study of the war[25] roosevelt summarized one of the primary morals of the war it must be but a poor spirited american whose veins do not tingle with pride when he reads of the cruises and fights of the sea-captains and their grim prowess which kept the old yankee flag floating over the waters of the atlantic for three years in the teeth of the mightiest naval power the world has ever seen[26]
first marriage and widowerhood on his 22nd birthday roosevelt married socialite alice hathaway lee daughter of banker george cabot lee and caroline watts haskell their daughter alice lee roosevelt was born on february 12 1884 roosevelt's wife died two days after giving birth due to an undiagnosed case of kidney failure (called bright's disease at the time) which had been masked by the pregnancy in his diary roosevelt wrote a large 'x' on the page and then the light has gone out of my life his mother mittie had died of typhoid fever eleven hours earlier at 300&#160am in the same house distraught roosevelt left baby alice in the care of his sister bamie in new york city while he grieved he assumed custody of his daughter when she was three[20]
roosevelt also reacted by focusing on work specifically by re-energizing a legislative investigation into corruption of the new york city government which arose from a concurrent bill proposing that power be centralized in the mayor's office[27] for the rest of his life he rarely spoke about his wife alice and did not write about her in his autobiography while working with joseph bucklin bishop on a biography that included a collection of his letters roosevelt did not mention his marriage to alice nor his second marriage to edith kermit carow [28]
early political career roosevelt as ny state assemblyman 1883 state assemblyman roosevelt was soon put forth as the republican party's candidate for the district's house seat in albany[29] he was a member of the new york state assembly (new york co 21st d) in 1882 1883 and 1884 he immediately began making his mark specifically in corporate corruption issues[30] he blocked a corrupt effort by financier jay gould to lower his taxes roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by judge theodore westbrook and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed aiming for the impeachment of the judge the investigation committee rejected impeachment but roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in albany and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple new york publications[31] in 1883 roosevelt became the assembly minority leader in 1884 he lost the nomination for speaker to titus sheard by a vote of 41 to 29 in the gop caucus[32] roosevelt was also chairman of the committee on affairs of cities he wrote more bills than any other legislator[33]
presidential election of 1884 with numerous presidential hopefuls to choose from roosevelt supported senator george f edmunds of vermont a colorless reformer the gop preferred new york city's chester arthur who was known as a spoilsman roosevelt fought hard and succeeded in influencing the manhattan delegates in the state convention at utica he then took control of the state convention bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering the supporters of arthur and james g blaine he gained a national reputation as a key person in new york state[34]
roosevelt attended the gop national convention in 1884 and fought alongside the mugwump reformers they lost to the stalwart faction who nominated james g blaine in a crucial moment of his budding political career roosevelt resisted the demand of the mugwumps that he bolt from blaine he bragged about his one small success we achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the blaine nominee for temporary chairman to do this needed a mixture of skill boldness and energy to get the different factions to come in to defeat the common foe[35] he was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand the largest up to that date having gotten a taste of national politics roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level he then retired to his new chimney butte ranch on the little missouri[36] roosevelt refused to join other mugwumps in supporting grover cleveland the governor of new york and the democratic nominee in the general election he debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend henry cabot lodge after blaine won the nomination roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give hearty support to any decent democrat he distanced himself from the promise saying that it had not been meant for publication[37] when a reporter asked if he would support blaine roosevelt replied that question i decline to answer it is a subject i do not care to talk about[38] in the end he realized that he had to support blaine to maintain his role in the gop and he did so in a press release on july 19[39]
in 1886 roosevelt was the republican candidate for mayor of new york city portraying himself as the cowboy of the dakotas gop precinct workers warned voters that the independent radical candidate henry george was leading and that roosevelt would lose thus causing a last-minute defection of gop voters to the democratic candidate abram hewitt roosevelt took third place with 27% (60435 votes) hewitt won with 41% (90552 votes) and george was held to 31% (68110 votes)[40]
cowboy in dakota theodore roosevelt as badlands hunter in 1885 new york studio photo roosevelt built a second ranch named elk horn thirty-five miles (56&#160km) north of the boomtown of medora north dakota on the banks of the little missouri roosevelt learned to ride western style rope and hunt though he earned the respect of the authentic cowboys they were not overly impressed[41] however he identified with the herdsman of history a man he said possesses few of the emasculated milk-and-water moralities admired by the pseudo-philanthropists but he does possess to a very high degree the stern manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation[42][43] he reoriented and began writing about frontier life for national magazines he also published three books � hunting trips of a ranchman ranch life and the hunting-trail and the wilderness hunter[44]
as a deputy sheriff roosevelt pursued three outlaws who had stolen his riverboat and escaped north up the little missouri he captured them but decided against a vigilante hanging instead he sent his foreman back by boat and conveyed the thieves to dickinson for trial he assumed guard over them for forty hours without sleep while reading leo tolstoy to keep himself awake when he ran out of his own books he read a dime store western that one of the thieves was carrying[45] on another occasion while searching for a group of relentless horse thieves roosevelt met seth bullock the famous sheriff of deadwood south dakota the two would remain friends for life[46]
roosevelt brought his desire to address the common interests of citizens to the west he successfully led efforts to organize ranchers to address the problems of overgrazing and other shared concerns his work resulted in the formation of the little missouri stockmen's association he was also compelled to coordinate conservation efforts and was able to form the boone and crockett club whose primary goal was the conservation of large game animals and their habitats[47] after the uniquely severe us winter of 1886�1887 wiped out his herd of cattle and those of his competitors and with it over half of his $80000 investment roosevelt returned to the east[48][49]
second marriage on december 2 1886 roosevelt married his childhood and family friend edith kermit carow (august 6 1861 � september 30 1948) a daughter of charles carow and gertrude elizabeth tyler[50] the couple married at st george's hanover square in london england english diplomat cecil arthur spring rice roosevelt's close friend served as best man[51] the couple honeymooned in europe and while there roosevelt led a group to the summit of mont blanc an achievement that resulted in his induction into the royal society of london[52] they had five children theodore ted iii (1887�1944) kermit (1889�1943) ethel (1891�1977) archibald (1894�1979) and quentin (1897�1918) at the time of ted's birth roosevelt was both eager and worried for edith after losing his first wife alice shortly after childbirth[20]
reentering public life civil service commission in the 1888 presidential election roosevelt successfully campaigned primarily in the midwest for benjamin harrison president harrison appointed roosevelt to the united states civil service commission where he served until 1895 while in office roosevelt vigorously fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws[53] the new york sun then described roosevelt as irrepressible belligerent and enthusiastic[54] despite roosevelt's support for harrison's reelection bid in the presidential election of 1892 the eventual winner grover cleveland (a bourbon democrat) reappointed him to the same post[55] roosevelt's close friend and biographer joseph bucklin bishop described his assault on the spoils system
the very citadel of spoils politics the hitherto impregnable fortress that had existed unshaken since it was erected on the foundation laid by andrew jackson was tottering to its fall under the assaults of this audacious and irrepressible young man whatever may have been the feelings of the (fellow republican party) president (harrison)�and there is little doubt that he had no idea when he appointed roosevelt that he would prove to be so veritable a bull in a china shop�he refused to remove him and stood by him firmly till the end of his term[54]
new york city police commissioner in 1894 a group of reform republicans approached roosevelt about running for mayor of new york again he declined mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the washington social set soon after he declined he realized that he had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career he retreated to the dakotas for a time his wife edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed that there would be no repeat of it[56]
nyc police commissioner roosevelt walks the beat with journalist jacob riis in 1894�illustration from riis' autobiography roosevelt became president of the board of the new york city police commissioners for two years in 1895 and radically reformed the police force the new york police department (nypd) was reputed as one of the most corrupt in america the nypd's history division records that roosevelt was an iron-willed leader of unimpeachable honesty (who) brought a reforming zeal to the new york city police commission in 1895[57] roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams he appointed 1600 recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications regardless of political affiliation established meritorious service medals and closed corrupt police hostelries during his tenure a municipal lodging house was established by the board of charities and roosevelt required officers to register with the board he also had telephones installed in station houses[58]
in 1894 roosevelt met jacob riis the muckraking evening sun newspaper journalist who was opening the eyes of new yorkers to the terrible conditions of the city's millions of poor immigrants with such books as how the other half lives riis described how his book affected roosevelt
when roosevelt read [my] book he came no one ever helped as he did for two years we were brothers in (new york city's crime-ridden) mulberry street when he left i had seen its golden age there is very little ease where theodore roosevelt leads as we all of us found out the lawbreaker found it out who predicted scornfully that he would knuckle down to politics the way they all did and lived to respect him though he swore at him as the one of them all who was stronger than pull that was what made the age golden that for the first time a moral purpose came into the street in the light of it everything was transformed[59]
roosevelt made a habit of walking officers' beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure that they were on duty[60] he made a concerted effort to uniformly enforce new york's sunday closing law in this he ran up against boss tom platt as well as tammany hall�he was notified that the police commission was being legislated out of existence roosevelt chose to defer rather than split with his party[61] as governor of new york state before becoming vice president in march 1901 roosevelt signed an act replacing the police commissioners with a single police commissioner[62]
emergence as a national figure assistant secretary of the navy roosevelt had demonstrated through his research and writing a fascination with naval history president william mckinley urged by roosevelt's close friend congressman henry cabot lodge appointed roosevelt as the assistant secretary of the navy in 1897[63] secretary of the navy john d long was more concerned about formalities than functions was in poor health and left major decisions to roosevelt roosevelt seized the opportunity and began pressing his national security views regarding the pacific and the caribbean on mckinley roosevelt was particularly adamant that spain be ejected from cuba to foster the latter's independence and to demonstrate the us resolve to reenforce the monroe doctrine[64] ten days after the battleship maine exploded in the harbor of havana cuba the secretary left the office and roosevelt became acting secretary for four hours roosevelt cabled the navy worldwide to prepare for war ordered ammunition and supplies brought in experts and went to congress asking for the authority to recruit as many sailors as he wanted[65] roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the navy for the spanish�american war roosevelt had an analytical mind even as he was itching for war he explained his priorities to one of the navy's planners in late 1897
i would regard war with spain from two viewpoints first the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the cubans and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of america from european dominion second the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the navy and army in actual practice[66]
col theodore roosevelt war in cuba main article rough riders prior to his service in the spanish�american war roosevelt had already seen reserve military service from 1882 to 1886 with the new york national guard commissioned on august 1 1882 as a 2nd lieutenant with b company 8th regiment he was promoted to captain and company commander a year later and he remained in command until he resigned his commission[67][68][69][70][71]
when the united states and spain declared war against each other in late april 1898 roosevelt resigned from his civilian leadership job with the navy on may 6 and formed the first us volunteer cavalry regiment along with army colonel leonard wood[72] referred to by the press as the rough riders the regiment was one of many temporary units active only for the duration of the war[73]
after securing modern multiple-round krag smokeless carbines lieutenant colonel roosevelt arrived on may 15[69] the regiment trained for several weeks in san antonio texas and in his autobiography roosevelt wrote that his prior national guard experience had been invaluable in that it enabled him to immediately begin teaching his men basic soldiering skills[74] the rough riders used some standard issue gear and some of their own design purchased with gift money diversity characterized the regiment which included ivy leaguers professional and amateur athletes upscale gentlemen as well as cowboys frontiersmen native americans hunters miners prospectors former soldiers tradesmen and sheriffs the rough riders were part of the cavalry division commanded by former confederate general joseph wheeler it was one of three divisions in the v corps under lieutenant general william rufus shafter roosevelt and his men departed tampa on june 13 landed in daiquiri cuba on june 23 1898 and marched to siboney wheeler sent parts of the 1st and 10th regular cavalry on the lower road northwest and sent the rough riders on the parallel road running along a ridge up from the beach to throw off his infantry rival wheeler left one regiment of his cavalry division the 9th at siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong roosevelt was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment when wood was put in command of the brigade
main article battle of las guasimas the rough riders had a short minor skirmish known as the battle of las guasimas they fought their way through spanish resistance and together with the regulars forced the spaniards to abandon their positions[75]
main article battle of san juan hill colonel roosevelt and the rough riders after capturing kettle hill along with members of the 3rd volunteers and the regular army black 10th cavalry under his leadership the rough riders became famous for the charge up kettle hill on july 1 1898 while supporting the regulars roosevelt had the only horse and rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up kettle hill an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors he was forced to walk up the last part of kettle hill because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire the victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1000 wounded[76]
roosevelt commented on his role in the battles on the day of the big fight i had to ask my men to do a deed that european military writers consider utterly impossible of performance that is to attack over open ground an unshaken infantry armed with the best modern repeating rifles behind a formidable system of entrenchments the only way to get them to do it in the way it had to be done was to lead them myself[77]
roosevelt as a veteran in august roosevelt and other officers demanded that the soldiers be returned home roosevelt always recalled the battle of kettle hill (part of the san juan heights) as the great day of my life and my crowded hour in 2001 roosevelt was posthumously awarded the medal of honor for his actions he had been nominated during the war but army officials annoyed at his grabbing the headlines blocked it[78] after returning to civilian life roosevelt preferred to be known as colonel roosevelt or the colonel however teddy remained much more popular with the public even though roosevelt openly despised it men working closely with roosevelt customarily called him colonel or theodore[79]
governor of new york chicago newspaper sees cowboy-tr campaigning for governor after leaving the army roosevelt discovered that new york republicans needed him because their current governor was tainted by scandal and would probably lose he campaigned vigorously on his war record winning the 1898 state election by a historical margin of 1%[80]
as governor roosevelt learned much about ongoing economic issues and political techniques that later proved valuable in his presidency he was exposed to the problems of trusts monopolies labor relations and conservation chessman argues that roosevelt's program rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state the rules for the square deal were honesty in public affairs an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large[81]
by holding twice-daily press conferences�which was an innovation�roosevelt remained connected with his middle-class political base[82] roosevelt successfully pushed the ford franchise-tax bill which taxed public franchises granted by the state and controlled by corporations declaring that a corporation which derives its powers from the state should pay to the state a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges it enjoys[83] he rejected boss thomas c platt's worries that this approached bryanite socialism explaining that without it new york voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises[84]
the new york state government affected many interests and the power to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for the governor platt insisted that he be consulted roosevelt appeared to comply but then made his own decisions historians marvel that roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with platt's approval he even enlisted platt's help in securing reform such as in the spring of 1899 when platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the civil service reform association called superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in america[85]

business roosevelt and fairbanks 1904 during the panic of 1907 nearly all agreed that a more flexible system to ensure liquidity was needed�the republicans sought a response to the money supply through the bankers whereas the democrats sought government control roosevelt was unsure but leaned towards the republican view while continuing to denounce corporate corruption[100] nonetheless in 1910 roosevelt commented on enormously wealthy and economically powerful men and suggested a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate[101][102]

the pursuit of an isthmus canal in central america during this period focused on two possible routes�nicaragua and panama which was then a rebellious district within colombia roosevelt convinced congress to approve the panamanian alternative and a treaty was approved only to be rejected by the colombian government when the panamanians learned of this a rebellion followed was supported by roosevelt and succeeded a treaty with the new panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903 [113]

examining the work of numerous scholars ricard (2014) reports that
the most striking evolution in the twenty-first century historiography of theodore roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist [regarding british relations these studies] have underlined cogently roosevelt's exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentieth-century special relationship the twenty-sixth president's reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and realpolitician has undeniably reached new heights in the twenty-first centuryyet his philippine policy still prompts criticism[115]
the media building on mckinley's effective use of the press roosevelt made the white house the center of news every day providing interviews and photo opportunities after noticing the reporters huddled outside the white house in the rain one day he gave them their own room inside effectively inventing the presidential press briefing the grateful press with unprecedented access to the white house rewarded roosevelt with ample coverage[116]
roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press which he used to keep in daily contact with his middle-class base while out of office he made a living as a writer and magazine editor he loved talking with intellectuals authors and writers he drew the line however at expose-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who during his term set magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians mayors and corporations roosevelt himself was not usually a target but his speech in 1906 coined the term muckraker for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges the liar he said is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves[117]
the press did briefly target roosevelt in one instance ever since 1904 he had been periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the panama canal in the least judicious use of executive power according to biographer brands roosevelt near the end of his term demanded that the justice department bring charges of criminal libel against joseph pulitzer's new york world the publication had accused him of deliberate misstatements of fact in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the panama affair though indictment was obtained the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court�it was not a federal offense but one enforceable at the state court level the justice department had predicted that result and had also advised roosevelt accordingly[118]
election of 1904 1904 election results main article united states presidential election 1904 the control and management of the republican party lay in the hands of chairman mark hanna until mckinley's death hanna's domination and potential rivalry for the party's nomination in 1904 began to wane with his own health issues and ultimate death early that year in deference to hanna's conservative loyalists roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to cornelius bliss but he declined roosevelt then turned to his own man george b cortelyou of new york the first secretary of commerce and labor to buttress his hold on the party's nomination roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the president[119] the president secured his own nomination but his preferred vice-presidential running mate robert r hitt wasn't nominated charles warren fairbanks was nominated[120]
while roosevelt followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump he sought to control the campaign's message through specific instructions to cortelyou he also attempted to manage the press's release of white house statements by forming the ananias club any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access[121]
the democratic party's nominee in 1904 was alton brooks parker roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote and parker received 38% roosevelt also won the electoral college vote 336 to 140 before his inauguration ceremony roosevelt declared that he would not serve another term[122]
post-presidency election of 1908 main article united states presidential election 1908 before leaving office while attempting to push through the nomination of william howard taft for the presidency in 1908 roosevelt declared taft to be a genuine progressive in january of that year roosevelt wrote the following to taft dear will do you want any action about those federal officials i will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word just weeks later he branded as false and malicious the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor taft[123]
taft easily defeated three-time candidate william jennings bryan taft promoted a different progressivism one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism along with the publicity devices the dedicated supporters and the broad base of public support that made roosevelt so formidable when roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the republican party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers he stopped talking about the issue taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high the resulting payne-aldrich tariff of 1909 was too high for most reformers but instead of blaming this on senator nelson wilmarth aldrich and big businesses taft took credit calling it the best tariff ever he again had managed to alienate all sides while the crisis was building inside the party roosevelt was touring africa and europe to allow taft to be his own man[124]
republican party schism punch depicts gop schism between taft and tr roosevelt had attempted to refashion taft into a younger version of himself but as soon as taft began to display his individuality roosevelt unveiled his disenchantment he was even offended on election night when taft wrote and indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of roosevelt but also his brother charley roosevelt was further alienated when taft again intent on becoming his own man did not consult him about cabinet appointments lodge empathized with roosevelt and therefore declined an offer to become secretary of state[125]
unlike roosevelt taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric however he was attentive to the law so he launched 90 antitrust suits including one against the largest corporation us steel for an acquisition that roosevelt had personally approved consequently taft lost the support of antitrust reformers (who disliked his conservative rhetoric) of big business (which disliked his actions) and of roosevelt who felt humiliated by his prot�g� more trouble came when taft fired roosevelt's friend and appointee gifford pinchot a leading conservationist pinchot alleged that taft's secretary of the interior richard ballinger was in league with big timber interests conservationists sided with pinchot and taft alienated yet another vocal constituency the left wing of the republican party began turning against taft senator robert m la follette sr of wisconsin joined with pinchot william white and hiram johnson to create the national progressive republican league their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace taft at the national level roosevelt declined to join this group�he was still reluctant to leave the gop[126] roosevelt back from europe unexpectedly launched an attack on the courts he gave his famous speech at osawatomie kansas in august 1910 which was the most radical of his career and openly initiated his break with the taft administration and the conservative republicans osawatomie was well known as the base used by john brown when he launched his bloody attacks on slavery advocating a program of new nationalism roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions[127]
roosevelt shortly thereafter made it clear in a meeting with lloyd carpenter griscom a new york republican regular that taft no longer enjoyed his support since he had deliberately abandoned their previous close relations[128] taft was deeply upset in the 1910 congressional elections democrats won a majority in the house and significantly diminished the republican's hold on the senate taft's reelection in 1912 was doubtful the republican progressives interpreted the defeat as compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911 and roosevelt reacted with renewed interest in more personal political endeavors[126] despite skepticism of la follette's new league roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles in fact between january and april 1911 roosevelt wrote a series of articles for the outlook defending what he called the great movement of our day the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy[129]

although the safari was ostensibly conducted in the name of science it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land-owning families and met many native peoples and local leaders roosevelt became a life member of the national rifle association in 1907[134] he wrote a detailed account of the safari in the book african game trails recounting the excitement of the chase the people he met and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science[135]

the 1912 primaries represented the first extensive use of the presidential primary a reform achievement of the progressive movement the primaries in the south where party regulars dominated went for taft as well as new york indiana michigan kentucky and massachusetts meanwhile roosevelt won in illinois minnesota nebraska south dakota california maryland and pennsylvania roosevelt also won taft's home state of ohio these primary elections while demonstrating roosevelt's continuing popularity with the electorate were not pivotal the final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee which was controlled by the party leaders headed by the incumbent president at the republican convention in chicago though taft's victory was not immediate the ultimate outcome was inevitably in his favor[142]

assassination attempt the bullet-damaged speech and eyeglass case on display at the theodore roosevelt birthplace on october 14 1912 while campaigning in milwaukee wisconsin roosevelt was shot by a saloonkeeper named john flammang schrank the bullet lodged in his chest after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket[148] roosevelt as an experienced hunter and anatomist correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood the bullet had not reached his lung and he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately instead he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt[149] he spoke for 90 minutes his opening comments to the gathered crowd were ladies and gentlemen i don't know whether you fully understand that i have just been shot but it takes more than that to kill a bull moose[150] afterwards probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in roosevelt's chest muscle but did not penetrate the pleura and it would be less dangerous to leave it in place roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life[151]
because of the bullet wound roosevelt was taken off the campaign trail in the final weeks of the race (which ended on election day november 5) though the other two campaigners stopped their own campaigns during the week roosevelt was in the hospital they resumed it once he was released the bullet lodged in his chest exacerbated his rheumatoid arthritis and prevented him from doing his daily stint of exercises roosevelt would soon become obese[152] in an era of party loyalty roosevelt failed to move enough republicans to vote a third party ticket he did win 41 million votes (27%) compared to taft's 35 million (23%) however wilson's 63 million votes (42%) were enough to garner 435 electoral votes roosevelt had 88 electoral votes and taft had 8 pennsylvania was roosevelt's only eastern state in the midwest he carried michigan minnesota and south dakota in the west california and washington he did not win any southern states[153]

during the trip down the river roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks the flesh wound he received however soon gave him tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in cuba fifteen years before[152] because the bullet lodged in his chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed his health worsened from the infection[156] this weakened roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure he had to be attended to day and night by the expedition's physician and his son kermit by then he could not walk because of the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in the other which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier roosevelt was riddled with chest pains fighting a fever that soared to 103&#160�f (39&#160�c) and at times made him delirious regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue[157]
despite roosevelt's continued decline and loss of over 50 pounds (20&#160kg) commander rondon reduced the pace of the expedition to allow for his commission's mapmaking and other geographical tasks which required regular stops to fix the expedition's position by sun-based survey upon roosevelt's return to new york friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue roosevelt wrote perhaps prophetically to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years for the rest of his few remaining years he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery[158] before roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over 625 miles (1000&#160km) long when he had recovered sufficiently he addressed a standing-room-only convention organized in washington dc by the national geographic society and satisfactorily defended his claims[157]

roosevelt's attacks on wilson helped the republicans win control of congress in the off-year elections of 1918 roosevelt was popular enough to seriously contest the 1920 republican nomination but his health was broken by 1918 because of the lingering malaria his family and supporters threw their support behind roosevelt's old military companion general leonard wood who was ultimately defeated by taft supporter warren g harding[166] roosevelt's youngest son quentin a pilot with the american forces in france was shot down behind german lines on july 14 1918 at the age of 20 it is said that quentin's death distressed roosevelt so much that he never recovered from his loss[167]

it is unwise to depart from the old american tradition and discriminate for or against any man who desires to come here and become a citizen save on the ground of that man's fitness for citizenship we can not afford to consider whether he is catholic or protestant jew or gentile whether he is englishman or irishman frenchman or german japanese italian or scandinavian or magyar what we should desire to find out is the individual quality of the individual man[175]

i have not been able to think out any solution of the terrible problem offered by the presence of the negro on this continent but of one thing i am sure and that is that inasmuch as he is here and can neither be killed nor driven away the only wise and honorable and christian thing to do is to treat each black man and each white man strictly on his merits as a man giving him no more and no less than he shows himself worthy to have[180] roosevelt appointed numerous african americans to federal offices such as walter l cohen of new orleans a leader of the black and tan republican faction whom roosevelt named register of the federal land office[181]
contrasting the european conquest of north america with that of australia roosevelt wrote the natives [of australia] were so few in number and of such a low type that they practically offered no resistance at all being but little more hindrance than an equal number of ferocious beasts[182] however the native americans were the most formidable savage foes ever faced ever encountered by colonists of european stock[183] he regarded slavery as a crime whose shortsighted folly was worse than its guilt because it brought hordes of african slaves whose descendants now form immense populations in certain portions of the land[184] contrasting the european conquest of north america with that of south africa roosevelt felt that the fate of the latter's colonists would be different because unlike the native american the african neither dies out nor recedes before their advance meaning the colonists would likely be swallowed up in the overwhelming mass of black barbarism[185]

the book is a capital book in purpose in vision in grasp of the facts our people most need to realize it shows an extraordinary range of reading and a wide scholarship it shows a habit of singular serious thought on the subject of most commanding importance it shows a fine fearlessness in assailing the popular and mischievous sentimentalities and attractive and corroding falsehoods which few men dare assail it is the work of an american scholar and gentleman and all americans should be sincerely grateful to you for writing it[190][191]
