according to paul kengor author of god and ronald reagan reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother nelle[10] and the disciples of christ faith[10] which he was baptized into in 1922[11] for the time reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination and recalled a time in dixon when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there reagan brought them back to his house where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning[12]

early political career 1948�67 reagan began his political career as a democrat he joined numerous political committees with a left-wing orientation such as the american veterans committee he fought against republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and for helen gahagan douglas in 1950 when she was defeated for the senate by richard nixon it was his realization that communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them[59]
reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension in december 1945 he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in hollywood by pressure from the warner bros studio he would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency specifically his opposition to mutually assured destruction building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them[60] in the 1948 election reagan strongly supported harry s truman appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in los angeles[61] however in the early 1950s as his relationship with actress nancy davis grew[62] he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of dwight d eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as richard nixon in 1960[63]

reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender barry goldwater in 1964[70] speaking for goldwater reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government consolidating themes he had developed in talks for ge he argued in a time for choosing (october 27 1964)
the founding fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people and they knew when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose so we have come to a time for choosingyou and i are told we must choose between a left or right but i suggest there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to man's age-old dream � the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order � or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism[71][72] this a time for choosing speech was not enough to turn around the faltering goldwater campaign but it was the key event that established reagan's national political visibility[73][74]
governor of california (1967�75) main article governorship of ronald reagan ronald and nancy reagan celebrate his gubernatorial victory at the biltmore hotel in los angeles california republicans were impressed with reagan's political views and charisma after his time for choosing speech[75] he announced in late 1965 his campaign for governor of california in 1966[76][77] he defeated former san francisco mayor george christopher in the gop primary in reagan's campaign he emphasized two main themes to send the welfare bums back to work and in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the university of california at berkeley to clean up the mess at berkeley[78] ronald reagan accomplished in 1966 what us senator william f knowland in 1958 and former vice-president richard m nixon in 1962 had tried he was elected defeating two-term governor edmund g pat brown and was sworn in on january 2 1967 in his first term he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget[79]
shortly after the beginning of his term reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a stop nixon movement hoping to cut into nixon's southern support[80] and be a compromise candidate[81] if neither nixon nor second-place nelson rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the republican convention however by the time of the convention nixon had 692 delegate votes 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination followed by rockefeller with reagan in third place[80]
reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era on may 15 1969 during the people's park protests at uc berkeley reagan sent the california highway patrol and other officers to quell the protests in an incident that became known as bloody thursday resulting in the death of student james rector and the blinding of carpenter alan blanchard[82][83] reagan then called out 2200 state national guard troops to occupy the city of berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters[82] a year after bloody thursday reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying if it takes a bloodbath let's get it over with no more appeasement[84] when the symbionese liberation army kidnapped patty hearst in berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food[85] conversely in that one afternoon bloody thursday 111 police officers were injured including one chp officer who was knifed in the chest after calling in the national guard the guard remained in berkeley for 17 days camping in people's park and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for people's park on hold[82][86]
the reagans meeting with president richard nixon and first lady pat nixon in july 1970 early in 1967 the national debate on abortion was beginning democratic california state senator anthony beilenson introduced the therapeutic abortion act in an effort to reduce the number of back-room abortions performed in california[82] the state legislature sent the bill to reagan's desk where after many days of indecision he signed it[87] about two million abortions would be performed as a result most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother[87] reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor he would not have signed it after he recognized what he called the consequences of the bill he announced that he was pro-life[87] he maintained that position later in his political career writing extensively about abortion[88]
in 1967 reagan signed the mulford act which became california penal code 12031 and 171(c) the bill repealed a law allowing public carrying of loaded firearms named after republican assemblyman don mulford the bill garnered national attention after the black panthers marched bearing arms upon the california state capitol to protest the bill[89][90]
despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968[91] reagan was re-elected in 1970 defeating big daddy jesse unruh he chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle one of reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment which he strongly supported[25] his efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the supreme court of california issued its people v anderson decision which invalidated all death sentences issued in california before 1972 though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment the only execution during reagan's governorship was on april 12 1967 when aaron mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in san quentin's gas chamber[92]
in 1969 reagan as governor signed the family law act an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the california state legislature for over two years[93] and became the first no-fault divorce legislation in the united states[94]
reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president by campaigning on a platform of sending the welfare bums back to work he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state he also strongly advocated the republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy including that of undue federal taxation[95]
reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by democratic california secretary of state jerry brown on january 6 1975
1976 presidential campaign main article republican party (united states) presidential primaries 1976 ronald reagan on the podium with gerald ford at the 1976 republican national convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination in 1976 reagan challenged incumbent president gerald ford in a bid to become the republican party's candidate for president reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the american conservative union which became key components of his political base while president ford was considered a more moderate republican[96]
reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager john sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of ford's likely nomination reagan won north carolina texas and california but the strategy failed as[97] he ended up losing new hampshire florida and his native illinois[98] the texas campaign lent renewed hope to reagan when he swept all ninety-six delegates chosen in the may 1 primary with four more awaiting at the state convention much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen including ernest angelo the mayor of midland and ray barnhart of houston whom president reagan would appoint in 1981 as director of the federal highway administration[99]
however as the gop convention neared ford appeared close to victory acknowledging his party's moderate wing reagan chose moderate senator richard schweiker of pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated nonetheless ford prevailed with 1187 delegates to reagan's 1070[98] ford would go on to lose the 1976 presidential election to the democrat jimmy carter
reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the soviet union though he lost the nomination he received 307 write-in votes in new hampshire 388 votes as an independent on wyoming's ballot and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the november election from the state of washington[100] which ford had won over democratic challenger jimmy carter

during reagan's presidency federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of 1981[137] which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11% however other tax increases passed by congress and signed by reagan ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were 182% of gdp as compared to 181% over the 40-year period 1970�2010[138] then in 1982 the job training partnership act of 1982 was signed into law initiating one of the united states' first public-private partnerships and a major part of the president's job creation program reagan's assistant secretary of labor and chief of staff al angrisani was a primary architect of the bill

judiciary main articles ronald reagan supreme court candidates and ronald reagan judicial appointments during his 1980 campaign reagan pledged that if given the opportunity he would appoint the first female supreme court justice[272] that opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated sandra day o'connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of justice potter stewart in his second term reagan elevated william rehnquist to succeed warren burger as chief justice and named antonin scalia to fill the vacant seat reagan nominated conservative jurist robert bork to the high court in 1987 senator ted kennedy a democrat of massachusetts strongly condemned bork and great controversy ensued[273] bork's nomination was rejected 58�42[274] reagan then nominated douglas ginsburg but ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use[275] anthony kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place[276] along with his three supreme court appointments reagan appointed 83 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 290 judges to the united states district courts
reagan also nominated vaughn r walker who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge[277] to the united states district court for the central district of california however the nomination stalled in the senate and walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by reagan's successor george h&#160w bush[278]
early in his tenure reagan appointed clarence m pendleton jr of san diego as the first african american to chair the united states commission on civil rights pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988 pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the comparable worth proposal as being looney tunes[279][280][281]
in 1984 reagan commuted the 18-year sentence of former louisiana commissioner of agriculture and forestry gil dozier a democrat from baton rouge to the time served for violations of both the hobbs and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations acts on september 23 1980 the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana convicted dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf[282] reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving[283][284]

alzheimer's disease announcement and reaction in august 1994 at the age of 83 reagan was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease[291] an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death[291][292] in november he informed the nation through a handwritten letter[291] writing in part
i have recently been told that i am one of the millions of americans who will be afflicted with alzheimer's disease at the moment i feel just fine i intend to live the remainder of the years god gives me on this earth doing the things i have always done i now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life i know that for america there will always be a bright dawn ahead thank you my friends may god always bless you[293]
after his diagnosis letters of support from well-wishers poured into his california home[294]
but there was also speculation over how long reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration[295] former cbs white house correspondent lesley stahl recounted that in her final meeting with the president in 1986 reagan did not seem to know who stahl was and that she came close to reporting that reagan was senile but at the end of the meeting reagan had regained his alertness[296] however dr lawrence k altman a physician employed as a reporter for the new york times noted that the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of alzheimer's can be fuzzy[297] and all four of reagan's white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimer's while he was president[297] dr john e hutton reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989 said the president absolutely did not show any signs of dementia or alzheimer's[297] reagan did experience occasional memory lapses though especially with names[297] reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992[298] or 1993[297] several years after he had left office his former chief of staff james baker considered ludicrous the idea that reagan slept during cabinet meetings[299] other staff members former aides and friends said they saw no indication of alzheimer's while he was president[297]
the reagans with a model of uss&#160ronald reagan may 1996 at left is newport news shipbuilding chairman and ceo bill fricks complicating the picture reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in july 1989 five years before his diagnosis after being thrown from a horse in mexico a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year[291][292] nancy reagan citing what doctors told her asserts that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of alzheimer's disease[292] although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate alzheimer's or dementia[300][301] reagan's one-time physician daniel ruge has said it is possible but not certain that the horse accident affected the course of reagan's memory[298]
progression as the years went on the disease slowly destroyed reagan's mental capacity[297] he was only able to recognize a few people including his wife nancy[297] he remained active however he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches played golf regularly and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby century city[297]
reagan suffered a fall at his bel air home on january 13 2001 resulting in a broken hip[302] the fracture was repaired the following day[303] and the 89-year-old reagan returned home later that week although he faced difficult physical therapy at home[304] on february 6 2001 reagan reached the age of 90 becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being john adams and herbert hoover with gerald ford george hw bush and jimmy carter later reaching 90)[305] reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease and as a result his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife nancy nancy reagan told cnn's larry king in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that ronnie would want people to remember him as he was[306] after her husband's diagnosis and death nancy reagan became a stem-cell research advocate urging congress and president george w bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research something bush opposed in 2009 she praised president barack obama for lifting restrictions on such research[307] mrs reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for alzheimer's[308]
death main article death and state funeral of ronald reagan reagan's casket lying in state in the united states capitol rotunda reagan died of pneumonia complicated by alzheimer's disease[309] at his home in bel air california on the afternoon of june 5 2004[310] a short time after his death nancy reagan released a statement saying my family and i would like the world to know that president ronald reagan has died after 10 years of alzheimer's disease at 93 years of age we appreciate everyone's prayers[310] president george w bush declared june 11 a national day of mourning[311] and international tributes came in from around the world[312] reagan's body was taken to the kingsley and gates funeral home in santa monica california later in the day where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and american flags in the grass[313] on june 7 his body was removed and taken to the ronald reagan presidential library where a brief family funeral was held conducted by pastor michael wenning his body lay in repose in the library lobby until june 9 over 100000 people viewed the coffin[314]

on june 11 a state funeral was conducted in the washington national cathedral and presided over by president george w bush eulogies were given by former british prime minister margaret thatcher[316] former canadian prime minister brian mulroney and both former president george hw bush and president george w bush also in attendance were mikhail gorbachev and many world leaders including british prime minister tony blair prince charles representing his mother queen elizabeth ii german chancellor gerhard schr�der italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and interim presidents hamid karzai of afghanistan and ghazi al-yawer of iraq[317]
after the funeral the reagan entourage was flown back to the ronald w reagan presidential library in simi valley california where another service was held and president reagan was interred[318] at the time of his death reagan was the longest-lived president in us history having lived 93 years and 120 days (2 years 8 months and 23 days longer than john adams whose record he surpassed) he is now the second longest-lived president just 45 days fewer than gerald ford he was the first united states president to die in the 21st century and his was the first state funeral in the united states since that of president lyndon b johnson in 1973
his burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the ronald reagan presidential library i know in my heart that man is good that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life[319]
legacy ronald reagan in 1976 at his home at rancho del cielo since reagan left office in 1989 substantial debate has occurred among scholars historians and the general public surrounding his legacy[320] supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of reagan's economic policies[321] foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the cold war[322] and a restoration of american pride and morale[110] proponents also argue reagan restored faith in the american dream with his unabated and passionate love for the united states[323] after a decline in american confidence and self-respect under jimmy carter's perceived weak leadership particularly during the iranian hostage crisis as well as his gloomy dreary outlook for the future of the united states during the 1980 election[324] critics contend that reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits[146] a wider gap in wealth and an increase in homelessness[156] and that the iran-contra affair lowered american credibility[325]
opinions of reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well edwin feulner president of the heritage foundation said that reagan helped create a safer freer world and said of his economic policies he took an america suffering from 'malaise' and made its citizens believe again in their destiny[326] however mark weisbrot co-director of the center for economic and policy research contended that reagan's economic policies were mostly a failure[327] while howard kurtz of the washington post opined that reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest[328]
despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d roosevelt leaving his imprint on american politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising[329] since he left office historians have reached a consensus[330] as summarized by british historian m j heale who finds that scholars now concur that reagan rehabilitated conservatism turned the nation to the right practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics revived faith in the presidency and in american exceptionalism and contributed to victory in the cold war[331]
cold war the cold war was a major political economic and military endeavor for over four decades but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of reagan's presidency[332] the significance of reagan's role in ending the cold war has spurred contentious and opinionated debate[333][334][335] that reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the soviet union is agreed but the extent of this role is continuously debated[250] with many believing that reagan's defense policies economic policies military policies and hard line rhetoric against the soviet union and communism as well as summits with general secretary gorbachev played a significant part in ending the cold war[155][250]
united states president ronald reagan (left) and president of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev meet in 1985 he was first among post�world war ii presidents to put into practice the concept that the soviet union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with a post-d�tente strategy[250] a conviction that was vindicated by gennadi gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman under gorbachev who said that the strategic defense initiative was very successful blackmail  the soviet economy couldn't endure such competition[336] reagan's aggressive rhetoric toward the ussr had mixed effects jeffery w knopf observes that being labeled evil probably made no difference to the soviets but gave encouragement to the east-european citizens opposed to communism[250]
general secretary gorbachev said of his former rival's cold war role [he was] a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the cold war[337] and deemed him a great president[337] gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war but rather a peaceful end he said he was not intimidated by reagan's harsh rhetoric[338] margaret thatcher former prime minister of the united kingdom said of reagan he warned that the soviet union had an insatiable drive for military power but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform[339] she later said ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired[340] said brian mulroney former prime minister of canada he enters history as a strong and dramatic player [in the cold war][341] former president lech wasa of poland acknowledged reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse[342] that reagan had little or no effect in ending the cold war is argued with equal weight that communism's internal weakness had become apparent and the soviet union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power[250] president harry truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the ussr and the soviet invasion of afghanistan undermined the soviet system itself[334]
domestic and political legacy reagan in minneapolis minnesota 1982 ronald reagan reshaped the republican party led the modern conservative movement and altered the political dynamic of the united states[343] more men voted republican under reagan and reagan tapped into religious voters[343] the so-called reagan democrats were a result of his presidency[343]
after leaving office reagan became an iconic influence within the republican party[344] his policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by republican presidential candidates since 1989[21] the 2008 republican presidential candidates were no exception for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates even imitating his campaign strategies[345] republican nominee john mccain frequently said that he came to office as a foot soldier in the reagan revolution[346] reagan's most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem[347]
reagan has become an iconic figure in the republican party with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard gop rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement washington post reporter carlos lozada notes how in the 2016 presidential race the main republican contenders have adopted standard gop gipper worship including even donald trump who previously had been skeptical[348]
the period of american history most dominated by ronald reagan and his policies concerning taxes welfare defense the federal judiciary and the cold war is known today as the reagan era and emphasizes that the conservative reagan revolution led by reagan had a permanent impact on the united states in domestic and foreign policy the clinton presidency (1993�2001) is often treated as an extension of the reagan era as is the bush presidency (2001�2009)[349] historian eric foner noted that the obama candidacy in 2008 aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of reaganism[350]
campaigning for the democratic nomination in 2008 barack obama an american liberal interpreted how reagan changed the nation's trajectory
i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not he put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it i think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating i think that people he just tapped into what people were already feeling which was we want clarity we want optimism we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing[351]
cultural and political image according to columnist chuck raasch reagan transformed the american presidency in ways that only a few have been able to[352] he redefined the political agenda of the times advocating lower taxes a conservative economic philosophy and a stronger military[353] his role in the cold war further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader[354][355] reagan's avuncular style optimism and plain-folks demeanor also helped him turn government-bashing into an art form[156]
ronald reagan's approval ratings date event approval (%) disapproval (%) march 30 1981 shot by hinckley 73 19 january 22 1983 high unemployment 42 54 april 26 1986 libya bombing 70 26 february 26 1987 iran-contra affair 44 51 january 20 1989 end of presidency 64 n/a career average 57 39 july 30 2001 (retrospective)[356] 64 27 as a sitting president reagan did not have the highest approval ratings[357] but his popularity has increased since 1989 gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history reagan ranked third of post�world war ii presidents in a 2007 rasmussen reports poll fifth in an abc 2000 poll ninth in another 2007 rasmussen poll and eighth in a late 2008 poll by united kingdom newspaper the times[358][359][360] in a siena college survey of over 200 historians however reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42[361][362] while the debate about reagan's legacy is ongoing the 2009 annual c-span survey of presidential leaders ranked reagan the 10th greatest president the survey of leading historians rated reagan number 11 in 2000[363]
ronald reagan's approval ratings (gallup 1981�89) in 2011 the institute for the study of the americas released the first ever uk academic survey to rate us presidents this poll of uk specialists in us history and politics placed reagan as the 8th greatest us president[364]
reagan's ability to connect with americans[365] earned him the laudatory moniker the great communicator[366] of it reagan said i won the nickname the great communicator but i never thought it was my style that made a difference�it was the content i wasn't a great communicator but i communicated great things[367] his age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image[368][369][370]
reagan also earned the nickname the teflon president in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration[371] according to congresswoman patricia schroeder who coined the phrase and reporter howard kurtz the epithet referred to reagan's ability to do almost anything wrong[371] and not get blamed for it[365][372]
public reaction to reagan was always mixed the oldest president was supported by young voters and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the republican party[373] reagan did not fare well with minority groups especially african-americans[214] this was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies[374] however his support of israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many jews[375] he emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency although he was the first president to have been divorced[376] the combination of reagan's speaking style unabashed patriotism negotiation skills as well as his savvy use of the media played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy[377]
