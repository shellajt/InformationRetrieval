he founded the university of virginia in his retirement from public office although ineffectual as an orator jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in america and europe most historians believe that after the death of his wife martha in 1782 he had a long-term relationship possibly non-consensual with his female slave sally hemings and fathered at least some of her children
in the aggregate jefferson is ranked by historians as the fifth most successful president

early life and career main article early life and career of thomas jefferson tuckahoe plantation jefferson's childhood home for 7 years jefferson was born the third of ten children on april 13 1743 (april 2 1743 os) at the family home in shadwell virginia[1] his father was peter jefferson a planter and surveyor who died when jefferson was fourteen his mother was jane randolph daughter of isham randolph a ship's captain and planter he showed little interest in learning about his ancestry on his father's side he only knew of the existence of his grandfather[2][3][a] jefferson's earliest memory was being handed to a slave on horseback and carried 50 miles away to their new home which overlooked the rivanna river in current albemarle county his facial appearance resembled that of his father but his slim physique was typical of his mother's family[2] he was of english and possible welsh descent[3]
peter jefferson's friend william randolph died a widower in 1745 having appointed peter as guardian to manage his tuckahoe plantation and care for his four children that year the jeffersons relocated to tuckahoe where they lived for the next seven years before returning to shadwell in 1752 peter jefferson died in 1757 and the jefferson estate was divided between peter's two sons thomas and randolph[4] thomas inherited approximately 5000 acres (2000&#160ha 78&#160sq&#160mi) of land including monticello and between 20 and 40 slaves and unfettered control of the property at age 21[5]
education main article thomas jefferson and education jefferson began his childhood education beside the randolph children with tutors at tuckahoe[6] in 1752 he began attending a local school run by a scottish presbyterian minister at age nine he initiated his study of latin greek and french he learned to ride horses and began nature studies he was taught from 1758 to 1760 by reverend james maury near gordonsville virginia while boarding with maury's family and there studied history science and the classics[7]
wren building (rear) college of william & mary where jefferson studied jefferson entered the college of william & mary in williamsburg virginia at age 16 and studied mathematics metaphysics and philosophy under professor william small small introduced him to the british empiricists including john locke francis bacon and isaac newton he also improved his french greek and his skill at the violin jefferson graduated in 1762 completing his studies in two years through small he made the acquaintance of law professor george wythe[8] jefferson read the law under the tutelage of wythe to obtain his law license while working as a law clerk in wythe's office he also read a wide variety of english classics and political works
jefferson treasured his books and in 1770 his shadwell home including a library of 200 volumes inherited from his father was destroyed by fire[9] nevertheless by 1773 he replenished his library with 1250 titles and in 1815 his collection had grown to almost 6500 volumes including some inherited from george wythe[10] he thus accumulated thousands of books for his library at monticello after the british burned the library of congress in 1814 he sold more than 6000 books to the library for $23950 then realizing he was no longer in possession of such a grand collection he wrote to john adams i cannot live without books he had intended to pay off some of his large debt yet started buying more books
marriage family and monticello on january 1 1772 jefferson married his third cousin martha wayles skelton the 23-year-old widow of bathurst skelton[11][12] their marriage took place at the house of martha's father and was conducted by the reverend william coutts[13] she was a frequent hostess for jefferson managed the large household and their joyful marriage is considered the happiest period of his life[14] martha read widely did fine needle work and was an skilled pianist jefferson who was accomplished on the violin and cello often accompanied her musically[15] it is said that she was attracted to him largely because of their mutual love of music[16][17] during their ten years of marriage martha bore six children martha patsy (1772�1836) jane (1774�1775) a son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777 mary wayles polly (1778�1804) lucy elizabeth (1780�1781) and another lucy elizabeth (1782�1785) only martha and mary survived more than a few years[18] after her father john wayles died in 1773 martha and her husband inherited 135 slaves 11000 acres (4500&#160ha 17&#160sq&#160mi) and the debts of his estate these took jefferson and other co-executors of the estate years to satisfy which contributed to his own financial problems[11]
jefferson's home monticello martha later suffered from ill health including diabetes and frequent childbirth further weakened her a few months after the birth of her last child she died on september 6 1782 at the age of 33 with jefferson at her bedside he was so distraught that in the following three weeks he shut himself in his room where he paced back and forth nearly to the point of exhaustion later he often took long rides on secluded roads to mourn for his wife[18][19] martha's mother had died young and as a girl martha lived with two stepmothers shortly before her death she told jefferson that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children and pleaded with him to never to marry again he made and kept a solemn promise in that regard[20][21]
jefferson in 1768 had begun construction of his primary residence monticello (italian for little mountain) on a hilltop overlooking a 5000 acre plantation[b] construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters appreciably assisted by jefferson's slaves[23] he moved into the south pavilion in 1770 where his wife martha joined him in 1772 turning monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the palladian style was his perennial project[24]
jefferson mastered architecture through self-study using various books and classical architectural designs of the day his primary authority was andrea palladio's the four books of architecture which exposed him to the principles of classical design[25][26] while serving as minister to france jefferson had the opportunity to survey the foremost classical buildings he had reviewed in his reading as well the modern trends in french architecture then fashionable in paris after working as secretary of state (1790�93) he began rebuilding monticello based on the concepts he had acquired in europe the remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency the most notable change being the octagonal dome[27][28]
lawyer and house of burgesses house of burgesses in williamsburg va where jefferson served 1769�1775 jefferson was admitted to the virginia bar in 1767 and then lived with his mother at shadwell[29] his law practice included clients from his mother's family the randolphs[30] and his work took him throughout the shenandoah valley[31] the fire at shadwell had also claimed his legal papers and notes for the coming term of court and though he was frantic george wythe consoled him with a line from virgil carry on and preserve yourselves for better times[32]
in addition to practicing law jefferson represented albemarle county as a delegate in the virginia house of burgesses from 1769 until 1775[33] he proved more willing to reform slavery in his early career than later when he became a more substantial slaveholder in 1769 he introduced legislation allowing masters to assume full control over the emancipation of slaves taking the discretion away from the royal governor and his general court jefferson had persuaded his cousin richard bland to spearhead the legislation's passage but the reaction in the house was strongly negative he recalled bland was treated with the grossest indecorum[34]
jefferson worked on a number of lawsuits on behalf of freedom-seeking slaves[35] he took the case of samuel howell without charging him a fee[36] howell of inter-racial grandparents claimed he should be freed before the statutory age of thirty-one required for emancipation in such a case jefferson invoking natural law argued everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will&#160 this is what is called personal liberty and is given him by the author of nature because it is necessary for his own sustenance the judge hearing the howell case abruptly cut him off and ruled against his client as a consolation jefferson gave howell some money presumably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter[36] jefferson later successfully incorporated the argument into the declaration of independence[37]
although earlier discouraged smallpox inoculation began in 1768�1769 in norfolk county virginia and precipitated riots jefferson defended the riots' victims including dr archibald campbell whose house was burned jefferson himself inoculated at age 23 gave up his law practice before the case was resolved but later served on a general assembly committee which sought to reduce the 1769 restrictions on the inoculations[38]
following the passage of the intolerable acts by the british parliament in 1774 jefferson wrote a resolution against the acts calling for the day of fasting and prayer in protest the resolution also called for a boycott of all british goods these were later expanded into a summary view of the rights of british america in which he expressed his belief that people had the right to govern themselves[39]
political career 1775�1800 declaration of independence us declaration of independence - 1823 facsimile of the engrossed copy jefferson served as a delegate to the second continental congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the american revolutionary war[40] he sought out john adams who along with the latter's cousin samuel had emerged as a leader of the congress[41] jefferson and adams established a permanent friendship which led to jefferson primary drafting of the declaration of independence adams supported jefferson's appointment to the committee of five formed to write the formal declaration in furtherance of the lee resolution passed by the congress[42] after discussing the general outline of the document the committee decided that jefferson would write the first draft the committee in general and jefferson in particular thought adams should write the document but adams persuaded the committee to choose jefferson though he was reluctant to take the assignment he agreed and adams promised to consult with him upon completion[c]
consulting with other committee members over the next seventeen days jefferson also drew on his own proposed draft of the virginia constitution george mason's draft of the virginia declaration of rights and other sources[43] the other committee members made some changes most notably jefferson had written we hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable&#160 which franklin changed to read we hold these truths to be self-evident[44] a final draft was presented to the congress on june 28 1776
congress debated the declaration and deleted nearly a fourth of the text most notably a passage critical of the slave trade[45] while jefferson resented the changes he did not speak publicly about the revisions [d] on july 4 1776 the congress ratified the declaration of independence and the delegates signed the document on august 2 the declaration is considered one of jefferson's major achievements his preamble is regarded as an enduring statement of human rights indeed the phrase all men are created equal has been called one of the best-known sentences in the english language containing the most potent and consequential words in american history[45][47]
jefferson viewed the independence of the american people from the mother country britain as breaking away from parent stock and that the war of independence from britain was a natural outcome of being separated by the atlantic ocean[48] in his view english colonists were compelled to rely on common sense and rediscover the laws of nature[48] he also maintained the independence of the original british colonies was part of a historical pattern following a similar divergence when the saxons left their mother country europe hundreds of years earlier and colonized britain[48]
virginia state legislator and governor after the colonies declared their independence jefferson was elected to the virginia house of delegates for albemarle county in september 1776 where the finalization of a state constitution was a priority[49][50] he commented on the drafting of the constitution saying he supported freehold suffrage by which only landowners could vote for nearly three years he assisted with the constitution he was especially proud of the bill for establishing religious freedom[51] he served as a delegate until 1779 another object of importance to him was to disestablish the anglican church in virginia but this was not done until 1786 while he was in france as us minister[52] after thomas ludwell lee died in 1778 jefferson was given the task of studying and revising the state's laws jefferson drafted 126 bills in three years including laws to establish fee simple tenure in land and to streamline the judicial system jefferson's statutes abolished primogeniture and provided for general education which he considered the basis of republican government[49] his bill for the more general diffusion of knowledge led to some small changes at the college of william & mary and reduced control by clergy[53]
governor's palace - governor jefferson's residence in williamsburg in 1779 at the age of thirty-six jefferson was elected governor of virginia by the two houses of the legislature for a term of one year then re-elected for an additional year[54] as governor in 1780 he transferred the state capital from williamsburg to richmond a range of measures were introduced by jefferson during his time as governor of virginia including public education inheritance laws and religious freedom he served as a wartime governor as the united colonies continued the revolutionary war against great britain and prepared richmond in 1780 for an attack by moving all military supplies to a foundry located five miles outside of town in january 1781 general benedict arnold captured the foundry during his invasion of richmond jefferson called for the virginia militia to defend the city but when the defense arrived led by sampson mathews it was too late to prevent the siege[55] jefferson evacuated richmond as the armies engaged[56]
cornwallis that spring dispatched a 250-man cavalry force led by banastre tarleton on a secret expedition to capture the governor and members of the assembly at monticello but jack jouett of the virginia militia thwarted the british plan jefferson escaped to poplar forest his plantation to the west[57] his gubernatorial term expired in june and he spent much of the summer with his family at poplar forest his tenure as governor in general and his decision to flee the capital in particular has been criticized[58] the members of the general assembly quickly reconvened in june 1781 in staunton virginia across the blue ridge mountains and considered an official inquiry into jefferson's actions as they believed he had failed his responsibilities as governor jefferson was not re-elected[50] in that year also his daughter lucy died at age one a second daughter of that name was born the following year but died as well at age 3[59]

member of congress independence hall assembly room where jefferson served in congress following its victory in the revolutionary war and peace treaty with great britain in 1783 the united states formed a continental congress to which jefferson was appointed as a virginia delegate as a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates he recommended an american currency based on the decimal system and his plan was adopted[67] he also advised formation of the committee of the states to fill the power vacuum when congress was in recess[68] when congress adjourned the following june the committee met but within two months disagreements divided the members jefferson learned of the ordeal while in france and spoke to franklin who compared the committee to a needed light house and its members to a raging sea rendering it inaccessible and dysfunctional[69]
in the 1783�84 session of the congress jefferson acted as chairman of important committees to establish a viable system of government for the new republic and propose a policy for the settlement of the western territories jefferson was the principal author of the land ordinance of 1784 whereby virginia ceded to the national government the vast area it claimed northwest of the ohio river he insisted this territory not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states but that it be divided into sections which could become states[70] he plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and also wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories congress made extensive revisions including rejection of the ban of slavery jefferson thought that congress had mutilated his work but accepted the majority's changes[71][72] the provisions banning slavery known later as the jefferson proviso were modified and implemented three years later in the northwest ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire northwest[71]
minister to france portrait of thomas jefferson while in london in 1786 by mather brown jefferson was sent by the confederation congress[e] to join benjamin franklin and john adams as ministers in europe for negotiation of trade agreements with england spain and france some believed the recently widowed jefferson was depressed and that the assignment would distract him from his wife's death[73] taking his young daughter patsy and two servants he departed from boston in july of 1784 and arrived in paris the next month[70][74] jefferson taught himself to read and write spanish during the nineteen-day voyage using a copy of don quixote[75]
four days after his arrival jefferson rode out to passy to greet franklin[76] when the french foreign minister the count de vergennes commented to jefferson you replace monsieur franklin i hear jefferson replied i succeed him no man can replace him[77][78] franklin resigned as minister to france in march 1785 and departed in july after a ceremony at passy[79]
jefferson had patsy educated at the pentemont abbey he taught her french and helped her with her studies to serve the household jefferson brought some of his slaves including james hemings whom he had trained in french cuisine[80] in 1786 jefferson through his artist friend john trumbull met and fell in love with maria cosway an accomplished and married italian-english musician of 27 they saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks she returned to great britain but they maintained a lifelong correspondence[81] jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child nine-year-old polly in june 1787 she was accompanied by sally hemings a slave and younger sister of james that year he suffered a fall and fractured his right wrist requiring him to write with his left hand at least for a time[82]
while in france he became a regular companion of lafayette and used his influence to procure trade agreements with france duties on whale oil were removed and jefferson directed more of the tobacco trade directly to france eliminating british intermediaries[83][84] he often dined with many of the city's prominent people and accumulated various wines for return to the united states[85] jefferson corresponded with many pivotal supporters of revolution including the comte de mirabeau a popular pamphleteer who repeated ideals that had been the basis for the american revolution[86][87] he wrote a letter to edward carrington expressing similar concepts he held of the natural tendencies of government and its relationship to the people saying in one instance the natural process of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground[88]
as the french revolution began jefferson allowed his paris residence the h�tel de langeac to be used for meetings by lafayette and other republicans he was in paris during the storming of the bastille[89] jefferson often found his mail opened and inspected by various postmasters so he began to write his important messages using a code and invented his own enciphering device the wheel cipher[90] indeed he wrote important communications in codes the remainder of his career[91] jefferson left paris in september 1789 he thought temporarily[92] but was prevented from returning by virtue of his appointment as the nation's chief diplomat[93] he remained a firm supporter of the french revolution although he was opposed to some of its very violent elements[94]
secretary of state see also first party system thomas jefferson
portrait by charles peale 1791 soon after jefferson's return from france he accepted president washington's invitation to serve as secretary of state[95] in his new position jefferson strongly opposed treasury secretary alexander hamilton on issues of national fiscal policy especially the funding of war debts[96] he later associated hamilton's federalist party with royalism and said the hamiltonians were panting after&#160 crowns coronets and mitres[97]
the first major issues before the cabinet were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital jefferson had always opposed the mounting debt hamilton desirous of the national government consolidating the various states' debts proposed his assumption bill to which jefferson found objection[98] they also differed on the permanent location of the capital hamilton wanted the capital close to the major commercial centers of the northeast whereas washington and jefferson along with other agrarians wanted it located to the south after much deliberation the compromise of 1790 was struck at a private dinner including madison under the terms of this agreement the nation's capital was located on the potomac river and the federal government assumed the war debts of all 13 states[99]
in may 1792 jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape and wrote to washington urging him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence the confidence of the whole nation is centred in you you being at the helm will be more than an answer to every argument which can be used to alarm and lead the people in any quarter into violence or secession[100] he entreated the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests as espoused by the federalists historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of democratic-republican party principles[101] in their opposition to hamilton jefferson and other democratic-republican organizers favored states' rights and local control and sought to prevent concentration of power in a central government he continued to work closely with madison to strengthen the party[102]
the french minister citizen genet said in 1793 senator morris and secretary of the treasury hamilton&#160 had the greatest influence over the president's mind and that it was only with difficulty that he [jefferson] counterbalanced their efforts[103] jefferson supported france against britain when they fought in 1793[104] he believed that political success at home depended on victory for the french army in europe with reservation as to the brutality of the french revolution
during his discussions with george hammond first british minister to the us beginning in 1791 jefferson tried unsuccessfully to obtain british agreement 1) to acknowledge their violation of the treaty of paris 2) to vacate their posts in the northwest and 3) to compensate the united states for slaves whom the british had freed at the end of the war in keeping with a passion for his private life jefferson resigned the cabinet position in december 1793 he is also said to have considered it an opportune time to bolster his political influence from outside the administration future developments indeed bore that out[105]
from his base at monticello he organized nationwide opposition to the jay treaty of 1794 thereby giving his party a bona fide cause to harness in combatting the federalists[106] the treaty was designed by hamilton and supported by washington it aimed to reduce tensions and enhance friendly relations as well as trade with britain jefferson warned that it would increase british influence and subvert republicanism saying thus it is that hamilton jay etc in the boldest act they ever ventured on to undermine the government&#160 a bolder party stroke was never struck[107] the treaty passed but he made sure it was not renewed when it expired in 1805 jefferson continued his pro-french stance during the violence of the reign of terror in france he declined to disavow the revolution because to back away from france would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in america[108]
election of 1796 and vice presidency further information united states presidential election 1796 and democrat-republican party 1796 electoral college vote in the presidential campaign of 1796 jefferson lost the electoral college vote to federalist john adams by 71�68 and he was thereby elected as vice president he initially intended to forego the swearing-in ceremony which he thought monarchical but relented[109] as the commensurate presiding officer of the senate jefferson assumed a more passive role than adams had as vice president he allowed the senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to issues of procedure which brought him an honorable and easy role he was concerned about the absence of rules as to his authority over the senate years before holding this premier office jefferson had studied parliamentary law and procedure for forty years and had transcribed notes on parliamentary law into a manual which he entitled parliamentary pocket book making him uniquely qualified to preside in the senate[110] he had also served on the committee appointed to draw up the rules of order for the continental congress in 1776 and as vice president he was able to formulate some senatorial procedures
with the quasi-war underway the federalists under john adams rebuilt the military levied new taxes and enacted the alien and sedition acts jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress democratic-republicans rather than prosecute enemy aliens and also thought they were unconstitutional saying the violations of the constitution propensities to war to expense&#160 which we have lately seen are becoming evident to the people&#160[111] to rally opposition he and madison anonymously wrote the kentucky and virginia resolutions respectively declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states[112] though the resolutions followed the interposition approach of madison jefferson advocated nullification jefferson's kentucky draft said where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact (casus non f�deris) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits[113]
in writing the kentucky resolutions jefferson warned that unless arrested at the threshold the alien and sedition acts would necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood[114] historian chernow has opined that the theoretical damage of the kentucky and virginia resolutions was deep and lasting and was a recipe for disunion[115] washington was so appalled by them that he told patrick henry that if systematically and pertinaciously pursued they would dissolve the union or produce coercion[116] the influence of jefferson's doctrine of states' rights is said to have reverberated to the civil war and beyond[117]
he held four confidential talks with the french consul joseph letombe in the spring of 1797 in these meetings jefferson attacked adams predicted that he would only serve one term and encouraged france to invade england jefferson advised letombe to stall any american envoys sent to paris by instructing him to listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings this toughened the tone that the french government adopted with the new adams administration due to pressure on the adams administration from jefferson and his supporters congress released the papers related to the xyz affair which rallied a shift in popular opinion from jefferson and the french government to the support of adams[117]

on february 17 1801 after thirty-six ballots the house elected jefferson president and burr vice president[119] jefferson is said to have owed his election victory to the south's inflated number of electors which counted slaves under the three-fifths compromise[120][121] it was also alleged that jefferson through maryland representative samuel smith secured james asheton bayard's tie-breaking electoral vote in exchange for guaranteeing the retention of various federalist posts in the government[122] jefferson disputed the allegation and no documents are conclusive[123]

he was regarded by his supporters as the 'people's president' jefferson's election was well received and the event was marked by celebrations throughout the country nevertheless at the time partisan strife between the democratic-republican and federalist parties had grown to new levels some of jefferson's political opponents referred to him as the negro president with critics like the mercury and new-england palladium of boston stating that he had the gall to celebrate his election as a victory for democracy when he won the temple of liberty on the shoulders of slaves[121]
upon assumed office he first confronted an $83 million national debt[125] he began to dismantle hamilton's federalist fiscal system his secretary of treasury albert gallatin claimed that if this administration shall not reduce taxes they never will be permanently reduced[126] the swiss born gallatin was jefferson's most valued administrator and a critic of alexander hamilton's fiscal policy[127] jefferson's administration began by eliminating the whiskey excise and all other federal internal taxes claiming that closing unnecessary offices as well as cutting useless establishments and expenses allowed for the discontinuation of internal taxes[128][129] the new executive also attempted to disassemble the national bank and its effect of increasing the national debt also reduced was much of the navy deemed unnecessary during peacetime[130] jefferson nominated moderate republicans including james madison as secretary of state henry dearborn secretary of war levi lincoln attorney general and robert smith secretary of navy[127] at the conclusion of his two terms he had reduced the national debt by over $12 million[131]
in may 1801 the secretary of war henry dearborn announced that the president had appointed major jonathan williams to investigate the establishment of a national school of military education[132] following the advice of washington adams hamilton and others[133] jefferson and the congress in 1802 authorized the funding and construction of the united states military academy at west point on the hudson river on march 16 1802 he signed the military peace establishment act directing that a corps of engineers be established and constitute a military academy the act provided well-trained officers for a professional army the operation of the us military academy at west point formally started on july 4 1802

jefferson had previously recommended naval forces be limited to those required for coastal defense but the pirate attacks and the systematic kidnapping of american crew members expanded the need in 1801 the cabinet voted unanimously to send a fleet of three frigates and a schooner to the mediterranean under the command of richard dale with orders to make a show of force while negotiating for peace if possible nevertheless tripoli declared war upon the united states[139] the american navy forced tunis and algiers into breaking their alliance with tripoli which ultimately left it disarmed jefferson also ordered five separate naval bombardments of tripoli which temporarily restored peace in the mediterranean[140]
louisiana purchase main article louisiana purchase in 1802 jefferson initiated a negotiation for the purchase of the city of new orleans and adjacent coastal areas from france the area under discussion mushroomed and napoleon i agreed to sell a territory in excess of a million square miles for $15 million less $375 million in previously settled debts owed to the us total inhabitants were 80000�90000 including about 40000 slaves the purchase was ratified by the senate by a vote of 24�7[141] most thought this was an exceptional opportunity apart from constitutional reservations as to the power of the government to acquire land[142] the new territory proved to be one of the largest fertile tracts of land on the planet and it marked the end of french imperial ambitions in north america which conflicted with american expansion west[143]
the louisiana purchase was domestically complicated by the pre-existing establishment of french slaveholders there faced with the option to confiscate the slaves of french nationals jefferson chose to quickly integrate resident settlers politically and legally into us territories allowing for slavery to continue in the newly acquired territory along with the local adoption of the code napoleon since the purchase historians have differed in their assessments regarding constitutional and slavery issues but jefferson's acquisition is considered a pivotal contribution toward america's western growth[144]

he made a deal with officials of georgia if georgia would release its legal claims to lands to its west the us military would help expel the cherokee people from georgia this facilitated his policy of western expansion to advance compactly as we multiply[156] his deal arguably violated an existing treaty between the united states government and the cherokee nation which guaranteed its people the right to their historic lands[155] jefferson believed that natives should abandon their own cultures religions and lifestyles and assimilate to western european customs and agriculture which was considered more beneficial[155][157] he also contended that integration of native americans into the european-american economy would make them more dependent on trade and they would eventually be willing to give up land in exchange for trade goods or debt curtailments[158] in keeping with his trade and acculturation policy jefferson kept benjamin hawkins as superintendent of indian affairs for the southeastern peoples who became known as the five civilized tribes for their adoption of european-american ways
haiti was founded in 1804 as the second republic in the world after its successful slave revolution in the french colony of saint-domingue jefferson refused to diplomatically recognize haiti fearing the success of the slave republic would rouse the american south's slaves to rebellion jefferson also supported an arms and trade embargo against haiti[159] nevertheless during the haitian revolution when jefferson wanted to discourage french control in 1802�1803 he allowed arms and contraband goods to reach saint-domingue[160]

jefferson requested congressional authority to employ land or naval forces of the us in cases of insurrection and in his message to congress on january 1807 he declared burr's guilt is placed beyond question by late march 1807 burr was arrested and charged with treason but was acquitted at trial wilkinson who barely escaped indictment had deleted from court documents evidence of his earlier collaboration with burr [164] jefferson did not appear in person to answer chief justice john marshall's subpoena to testify but sent relevant documents instead setting a precedent for executive privilege though burr's acquittal enraged jefferson his career was shattered[168] jefferson removed wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the us military [164]

jefferson's popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in europe positive relations with great britain had diminished due partly to the antipathy between jefferson and the british ambassador anthony merry and after napoleon's decisive victory at the battle of austerlitz in 1805 napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights which american efforts failed to counter jefferson then led the enactment of the embargo act of 1807 directed at both france and great britain this triggered economic chaos in the us and was strongly criticized at the time resulting in jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later[172]
following the revolution the states abolished the international slave trade but south carolina reopened it jefferson in his annual message of december 1806 denounced the violations of human rights attending the international slave trade calling on the newly elected congress to criminalize it immediately[173] in 1807 congress passed the act prohibiting importation of slaves which jefferson signed[174][175] while the act established severe punishment against international slave trade it did not address the issue domestically
in the wake of the louisiana purchase jefferson sought to annex florida from spain as brokered by emperor napoleon[176] congress agreed to the president's request to secretly appropriate purchase money in the $2000000 bill[176] the congressional funding drew criticism from randolph who believed the money would wind up in coffers of napoleon the bill was signed into law however negotiations for the project failed jefferson lost clout among fellow republicans and his use of unofficial congressional channels was sharply criticized[176]
chesapeake�leopard affair and embargo act main article chesapeake�leopard affair the british conducted raids on american shipping and kidnapped seamen in 1806�07 thousands of americans were thus impressed into their service in 1806 jefferson issued a call for a boycott of british goods on april 18 congress passed the non-importation acts but they were never enforced later that year jefferson asked james monroe and william pinkney to negotiate with great britain to end the harassment of american shipping though britain showed no signs of improving relations a treaty was finalized however it lacked any provisions to end impressment[177]
the british ship hms leopard fired upon the uss chesapeake off the virginia coast in june 1807 and jefferson prepared for war[178] he issued a proclamation banning armed british ships from us waters he presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms ammunition and supplies saying the laws of necessity of self-preservation of saving our country when in danger are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws] the uss revenge dispatched to demand an explanation from the british government was also fired upon jefferson called for a special session of congress in october to enact an embargo or in the alternative consider war[179]
a political cartoon showing merchants dodging the ograbme which is 'embargo' spelled backwards (1807) in december news arrived that napoleon had extended the berlin decree globally banning british imports in britain george iii ordered redoubling efforts at impressment including american sailors but the war fever of the summer faded�congress had no appetite to prepare the us for war jefferson asked for and received the embargo act the optimal choice for him as it gained more time for building up defensive works militias and naval forces historian jon meecham opined the embargo act was a projection of power which surpassed the alien and sedition acts
secretary of state james madison supported the embargo with more vigor than jefferson while the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin opposed due to its indefinite time frame and the risk it posed to the policy of american neutrality[180] the us economy suffered and criticism grew with jefferson's party losing support and efforts began to work around the embargo instead of retreating jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators[181] three acts were passed in congress during 1807 and 1808 called the supplementary the additional and the enforcement acts[178] though the government could not prevent american vessels from trading with the european belligerents once they had left american ports the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports shortly before leaving office in march 1809 jefferson signed the repeal of the embargo in its place the non-intercourse act was passed but it proved no more effective[178]
jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of republican virtue by not complying with it[177] many historians have considered that jefferson's embargo was ineffective and harmful to american interests[182] others portray it as an innovative non violent measure which aided france in its war with britain while preserving american neutrality[177][183] jefferson maintained that had the embargo been widely observed it would have avoided war in 1812[184][185]

later years in the years following jefferson's political retirement he spent most of his time pursuing educational interests�selling his vast collection of books to the library of congress and founding and building the university of virginia[198]

university of virginia main article university of virginia the rotunda university of virginia he wanted to found a new institution of higher learning free of church influences where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities jefferson believed educating people was a effective way to establish an stable society and that schools should be paid for by the general public in order to be accessible to students from all social strata[200]
in 1800 jefferson wrote a letter to joseph priestley about his proposed university[201] in 1819 the 76-year-old jefferson founded the university of virginia he initiated and organized the legislative campaign for its charter and with the assistance of edmund bacon purchased the location jefferson was the principal designer of the buildings he also planned the university's curriculum and served as the first rector upon opening in 1825 it was the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students with no campus chapel included in the original plans the university was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church reinforcing the principle of separation of church and state
stylistically jefferson was a proponent of the greek and roman styles which he believed to be most representative of american democracy by historical association each academic unit was designed with a two-story temple front facing the quadrangle while the library was modeled on the roman pantheon in his vision any citizen of the state could attend school with the sole criterion being ability[202][203]
jefferson's educational ideas were expressed in the configuration of his campus plan which he called the academical village individual academic units were defined as distinct structures each housed classrooms faculty offices and residences gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind and surrounded by serpentine walls affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle
after jefferson died in 1826 james madison replaced him as the university rector[204] in a codicil to his last will jefferson left most of his library to the university[205] until his death jefferson invited students and faculty of the college to his home[206]

historical reputation jefferson memorial washington dc jefferson is a historical icon of individual liberty democracy and republicanism some have hailed him as among the most effective architects of the american revolution and as a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship[219] abraham lincoln called jefferson the most distinguished politician in our history[220] jefferson is widely championed as the primary author of the declaration of independence and for having written more than 18000 letters of political and philosophical substance during his life[221]
historians have also noted the discrepancy between his articulated views of slavery and his slaveholding a controversial tenure as governor of virginia arguable disloyalty under washington and adams his advocacy of nullification and secession some personal spending excesses and his diminished second term presidency[222] some historians have also criticized the harsh treatment of native americans during his tenure[223] yet others have noted jefferson was predominantly a kind and generous employer and master who expressed deep moral convictions against slavery[224][225] a number maintain that many of the criticisms leveled at jefferson overlook much and are politically and racially biased[226]
political philosophy and views see also jeffersonian democracy and republicanism in the united states jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of john locke francis bacon and isaac newton[227] whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived[228] he was also influenced by the writings of gibbon hume robertson bolingbroke montesquieu and voltaire[229] he thought the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues he was distrusting of cities and financiers favored decentralized government power and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies having supported efforts to disestablish the church of england[230] and having authored the virginia statute for religious freedom he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state[231] the republicans under jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century british whig party who believed in limited government[232] his democratic-republican party became dominant in early american politics and his views became known as jeffersonian democracy[233]
society and government according to jefferson citizens have certain inalienable rights and rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others&#160[234] jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against tyranny from the majority[235] while he believed most people could not escape corrupting dependence the franchise should be extended only to those who could including the yeoman farmer he disliked inter-generational dependence such as national debt and unalterable governments[236] he was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of equality threatened only by government[237] excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruptions rather than human nature he remained less suspicious of working democracy than many of his contemporaries[236]
as president jefferson tried to re-create the balance between the state and federal governments as it existed under the articles of confederation seeking to shift the balance of power back to the states he acted out of his republican theory that liberty could only be retained in small homogeneous societies he felt that the federalist system enacted by washington and adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence[236] many of jefferson's contradictions can be understood within this philosophical framework for example he opposed women's right to vote or any participation in politics because a government must be controlled by the economically independent instead he argued our good ladies&#160 are contented to soothe and calm the minds of their husbands returning ruffled from political debate[238]
democracy as a proponent of democracy jefferson considered it to be the very expression of society as a whole and called for national self-determination cultural uniformity and education of all males of the commonwealth[239] in his view public education and a free press were essential to a democratic nation if a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be&#160 the people cannot be safe without information where the press is free and every man able to read all is safe[240]
after leaving washington's cabinet as secretary of state by october 1795 jefferson's thoughts turned to the electoral bases of the republicans and federalists the republican classification of the united states for which he advocated included 1) the entire body of landholders everywhere and 2) the body of laborers without land[241] republicans united behind jefferson as vice president with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide including local committees and correspondence networks county committees framed local republican tickets and spawned partisan republican newspapers[242] privately jefferson promoted republican candidates to run for local state offices[243] he sought an aristocracy of merit an example being his vice presidential candidate choice in george clinton the child of irish immigrants[244]
beginning with jefferson's electioneering for the revolution of 1800 his democratic efforts were based on egalitarian appeals[245] jefferson in his later years referred to the 1800 election as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form one not effected indeed by the sword&#160 but by the&#160 suffrage of the people[246] voter participation grew in jefferson's two terms increasing to unimaginable levels compared to the federalist era with doubled turnouts[247] john quincy adams noted following jefferson's 1804 election the power of the administration rests upon the support of a much stronger majority of the people throughout the union than the former administrations ever possessed[244]
in retirement jefferson gradually became critical of his home state for violating the principle of equal political rights�the social right of universal male suffrage[248] initially with the onset of the revolution jefferson had accepted blackstone's principle that property ownership would lead to the independent will required from voters in a republic but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor[249] in the heat of the revolutionary era and afterward with jefferson's support several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to include male euro-american tax-paying citizens those owning either their own houses or their own tools and paying taxes on them[250] in response to a pamphlet advocating a virginia constitutional convention he went further than the radical convention promoters he sought a general suffrage of all taxpayers and militia-men as well as equal representation by voter population in the state legislature not skewed to favor slave-holding regions of the state he also favored a reform of virginia's county courthouse system to more nearly resemble that of the more democratic townships of new england[251]
banks first bank of us philadelphia 1791�1811 jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing which he thought created long-term debt bred monopolies and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor[252][253] he argued that each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations[254]
in 1791 president washington asked jefferson then secretary of state and alexander hamilton the secretary of the treasury if the congress had the authority to create a national bank while hamilton believed congress had the authority jefferson thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers he also was convinced it would assume powers not granted to the federal government by the states and therefore would violate the tenth amendment as well as the laws of mortmain alienage forfeiture distribution and monopolies[255][256][257]
jefferson used the agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party recruiting candidates for congress on the issue as early as 1792[258] in retirement jefferson reminded john taylor in 1816 that they had ever hated the banks which could destroy the state constitutions already suffering from speculators who sweep away the fortunes and morals of our citizens he thought banks were more dangerous than standing armies�swindling futurity on a large scale[259][260]
benefits of rebellion in a letter to james madison in 1787 jefferson wrote a little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical&#160 it is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government[261] similarly in a letter to abigail adams on february 22 1787 he wrote the spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that i wish it to be always kept alive it will often be exercised when wrong but better so than not to be exercised at all[261] concerning shays' rebellion after he had heard of the bloodshed jefferson wrote to william s smith john adams' son-in-law what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure[262] in another letter to smith that year jefferson wrote and what country can preserve its liberties if the rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms[261]
as late as 1804 before his second term began jefferson even seemed at ease with the prospect of dividing the nation into separate democracies in view of a prospective republic in the mississippi river valley they would be as much our children and our descendants alongside any coastal confederacy remaining i feel myself as much identified with that [western] country&#160 as with this [united states][263][g]
he said of the french revolution the liberty of the whole world was depending on the issue of the contest[264] jefferson once argued that america would become the world's great empire of liberty�that is the model for democracy and republicanism[265] on departing the presidency in 1809 he described america as &#160trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world the only monument of human rights and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence[266]
slavery main article thomas jefferson and slavery jefferson's 1795 farm book page 30 lists 163 slaves at monticello jefferson lived in the virginia planter economy largely dependent upon slavery as a wealthy slave owner he used slave labor to run his household plantation tobacco fields and various shops the first record jefferson made in regard to slave ownership was in 1774 when he owned 41[267][268] in his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves buying and selling them for the management of his affairs and regularly maintaining about 130 [269][270] jefferson purchased slaves on occasion in order to unite their families[271][272]
he felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master while utilizing many slaves for profit[273][274] historians are divided on whether he opposed the institution largely because he was silent on emancipation during his presidency and only freed a few slaves on his monticello plantation[275][276] some researchers suggest jefferson's slave ownership contrasted with his philosophy of all men are created equal[275] other historians however maintain that the sentiment in this statement is what actually inspired jefferson to advance legislation to abolish slavery and that he believed slavery was contrary to the laws of nature where everyone had a right to personal liberty[277][278]
in the 1790s jefferson opened his own mechanized nailery which enabled mostly younger slaves to make nails however while machinery in his shop allowed jefferson's slaves to work more efficiently he failed to convince southern farmers that machinery could displace slavery instead of eliminating the need for slaves he realized just how dependent on slave labor the south was[279] jefferson wrote in 1816 that where the disease is most deeply seated there it will be slowest in eradication in the northern states it was merely supercial and easily corrected in the southern states it is incorporated in the whole system[279]
jefferson accepted the consensus of his time that africans were an inferior race however a section on slavery was included in his first draft of the declaration of independence where he stated [the king] has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of distant people who never offended him captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation hither[280] this section of the declaration was omitted because it alarmed southerners who did not agree with such a bold statement and northerners who feared the disagreement on the matter would endanger a united front against britain[280] in his notes on the state of virginia (1785) he expressed a strong suspicion that the negro was inferior to whites in both the endowments of body and mind but wasn't sure if it was because they were a distinct race or were so because of time and circumstances[281]
historians have generally described jefferson as a benevolent slaveowner[282][283][284] though some historians have expressed doubts[285] jefferson did not allow his slaves to be overworked and gave them sundays christmas and easter off[282][283] according to a former monticello slave slaves were seldom punished except for stealing fighting or other serious offenses though there were some cases of excessive whippings at the hands of overseers[278][286] slaves were provided with log cabins with a fireplace good clothing and food and were allowed to have their own gardens and raise chickens which along with eggs and produce were sold by more than half the adult slaves to the jefferson household[287]
as previously noted president jefferson called for outlawing the trans-atlantic slave trade and he signed the act prohibiting importation of slaves into law[288] southern contemporary critics viewed jefferson as opposed to slavery for his notes on the state of virginia his letter to benjamin banneker in 1791 and his reference to st george tucker's federal plan to purchase and free slaves[289]
abolition and colonization although jefferson owned many slaves during his life it is widely held that he was opposed to the institution of slavery on moral and practical grounds[290] he made several attempts to advance legislation to abolish slavery and later proposed colonization of freed slaves to an independent country of their own in liberia[291][292] in 1779 he proposed a plan of gradual voluntary training sponsorship and resettlement for slave families to the virginia legislature three years hence he helped draft legislation to enable owners to free (manumit) slaves owners would only need a written manumission whereas owners previously had to pay to transport their slave out of state and the slave could only be freed for doing an act of public service or with permission from the commonwealth[280] jefferson proposed to the congress legislation in 1784 that would end slavery in the western territories in the year 1800 however this legislation was defeated by one vote in 1787 congress passed the northwest ordinance a partial victory for jefferson that terminated slavery in the north west territory much of virginia society as proven by robert carter's slave emancipation in 1791 was strongly opposed to freed slaves becoming citizens while their colonization was viewed as an alternative following the gabriel prosser rebellion in the summer of 1800 jefferson again proposed a colonization plan for freed slaves to prevent a race war[293] colonization became popular throughout the early 19th century while president he attempted to colonize emancipated virginia slaves to sierra leone off the coast of africa through british and portugal companies but these efforts were unsuccessful[294] the idea of recolonization was met with mixed reactions from proponents and critics among different political and religious groups[295]
while jefferson on occasion had expressed reservations about releasing unprepared slaves into freedom it was something he had sought according to his main overseer of slaves edmund bacon and his slave joseph fossett jefferson freed five slaves in his will providing a monetary endowment and trade tools to aid in making a living jefferson also successfully petitioned the virginia legislature to allow freed slaves to remain in virginia his encumbered debt from an agricultural depression and the mortgaging of his slaves legally prevented him from freeing the remaining slaves who were later auctioned locally by his heirs to pay his creditors and avoid their confiscation[296][297]
jefferson�hemings controversy main article jefferson�hemings controversy the claim that thomas jefferson fathered children by his slave sally hemings has been a matter of debate since 1802 that year journalist james t callender after being denied a position as postmaster by jefferson published allegations that jefferson had taken hemings as a concubine and had fathered several children with her[298] john wayles her father and slavemaster was also the father of jefferson's wife martha hemings was three-quarters white and strikingly similar in looks and voice to jefferson's late wife[299]
in 1998 in order to establish the male dna line a panel of researchers conducted a y-dna study of living descendants of jefferson's uncle field and of a descendant of hemings' son eston hemings the results published in the journal nature[300] showed a y-dna match with the male jefferson line in 2000 the thomas jefferson foundation (tjf) assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that together with the dna and historic evidence there was a high probability that jefferson was the father of eston and likely of all hemings' children w m wallenborn who worked on the monticello report disagreed claiming the committee's report was a rush to judgement and that the claims of jefferson's paternity were unsubstantiated and politically driven[301]
since the dna tests were made public most biographers and historians have concluded that the widower jefferson had a long-term relationship with hemings[302] other scholars including a team of professors associated with the thomas jefferson heritage society maintain that the evidence is insufficient to prove jefferson's paternity conclusively and note the possibility that other family members including his brother randolph jefferson and his five sons who often fraternized with slaves could have fathered hemings' children[303][304]
hemings' first child was conceived while she and jefferson were in france during his term as us ambassador the claim has been made that since slavery had been abolished in france hemings only agreed to come home with jefferson on condition that their children would be freed at the age of 2 and that jefferson kept this promise[280] however there is no written record or oral history of a claim by hemings that jefferson fathered any of her children[305] jefferson freed two slaves of the extended hemings family in the 18th century he allowed two of her children to leave monticello without formal manumission when they came of age five other slaves including the two remaining sons of hemings were freed by his will upon his death although not freed in jefferson's will hemings herself was freed by jefferson's daughter martha jefferson randolph after his death[280] she then left monticello with her sons and they were counted as free whites in the 1830 census[306]
religion further information thomas jefferson and religion jefferson's bible featuring only the words of jesus from the evangelists in parallel greek latin french and english although jefferson generally referred to himself as a christian by 1764 he had withdrawn from an orthodox christian belief after his personal scrutiny of new testament teachings found intolerable inconsistencies jefferson later wrote that he found two strains within the bible one that was as diamonds of the purest moral teaching[307] and another that was as a dunghill of priestcraft and roguery[308]
in 1777 jefferson drafted virginia's an act of establishing religious freedom submitted in 1779 the act was ratified in 1786 by the virginia legislature the act made it unlawful to compel men to attend or donate money to religious establishments and declared that men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion[309] jefferson initially supported restrictions banning clergy from holding public office however later in life he changed this view believing the clergy had the same rights as others to hold public office[310]
jefferson praised the morality of jesus and edited a compilation of his teachings omitting the miracles and supernatural references of the biblical account and titling it the life and morals of jesus of nazareth[311] this book is now known as the jefferson bible he claimed that christianity possessed the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man[312] he was firmly anticlerical saying that in every country and every age the priest has been hostile to liberty&#160 they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon unintelligible to all mankind and therefore the safer for their purposes[313]
jefferson's personalized christianity included a strict code of moral conduct and was inspired by classical literature[314] his belief system retained some christian principles but rejected many of the orthodox tenets of that time and was critical of the catholic church as he had observed it in france he advanced the idea of separation of church and state that the government should not have an official religion nor should it prohibit any particular religious expression he initially offered these thoughts in an 1802 letter to the danbury baptists in connecticut[315] in a private letter to benjamin rush in 1803 he explained some aspects of his personal belief system regarding christianity to the corruptions of christianity i am indeed opposed but not to the genuine precepts of jesus himself i am a christian in the only sense in which he wished any one to be sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others ascribing to himself every human excellence&#160[316]
jefferson noted both benevolence and contradictions in christian doctrine[317] in an 1820 letter to his close friend william short he stated it is not to be understood that i am with him [jesus] in all his doctrines i am a materialist he takes the side of spiritualism he preaches the efficacy of repentance toward forgiveness of sin i require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it in 1824 four years later jefferson had changed on his view of the materialism of jesus clarifying then that &#160the founder of our religion was unquestionably a materialist as to man[318]
as a landowner jefferson played a role in governing his local episcopal church when he was home he attended the episcopal church and raised his daughters in that faith[319][320] some have described him as a deist however due to his belief in a god which is actively involved in the guidance of human history[321] this does not sufficiently define his beliefs[322]
interests and activities jefferson was a farmer with a keen curiosity in new crops soil conditions garden designs and scientific agricultural techniques his main cash crop was tobacco but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable he tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat vegetables flax corn hogs sheep poultry and cattle to supply his family slaves and employees but he had cash flow problems and was always in debt [323][324]
in the field of architecture jefferson helped popularize the neo-palladian style in the united states through designs for the virginia state capitol in addition to the university of virginia and his own home among others[325][326] he was interested in birds and wine and was a noted gourmet he was also a prolific writer and linguist and spoke several languages[327] as a naturalist he was compelled to purchase the natural bridge[328]
linguistics jefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics could read and write in a number of languages and was fluent in several including greek italian french and german he claimed to have taught himself spanish in nineteen days using only a grammar guide and a copy of don quixote though colleagues were skeptical john quincy adams dismissed jefferson's account as one of the exaggerative large stories he was inclined to tell[329] he also collected and understood a number of american indian vocabularies and instructed lewis and clark to record and collect various indian dialects during their expedition[330] he studied the ancient anglo-saxon language in a linguistic and philosophical capacity in his early years he excelled in classical language while at boarding school[331] where he received a classical education in greek and latin[332] and was known to keep his greek grammar book with him everywhere he went he later came to regard the greek language as the perfect language as expressed in its laws[333] consequently becoming keenly interested in linguistics and political philosophy altogether while attending the college of william & mary he taught himself italian[334] here jefferson first became familiar with the anglo-saxon language especially as it was associated with english common law and system of government he was so interested in the subject that while pursuing law he set aside time to devote to its study as the college offered no such curriculum
linguistics played a significant role in how jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas he believed that the progression of language provided a good model for the advancement of political thought that change in language was the result of common sense natural law and consequently public acceptance and usage[335] he understood the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language while criticizing the british for not recognizing various colonial dialects jefferson wanted the english language largely left intact and taught that way to american school children[335] he owned a wide variety of multiple language dictionaries including webster's a compendious dictionary of the english language 1806[336] much of jefferson's correspondence is earmarked with greek and latin quotations and other references to language[333][337] jefferson later included italian and anglo-saxon among the languages taught at the university of virginia[334][338]
although his political career and private activities required him to speak in public and his writing on a wide range of topics was regarded as brilliant jefferson was not known as a good orator and preferred to remain silent if possible instead of delivering his state of the union addresses himself jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in congress this started a tradition which continued until 1913 when woodrow wilson chose to deliver his own state of the union address[339]
inventions portable writing desk invented and used by jefferson in writing the declaration jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions these include the design for a revolving book-stand to hold five volumes at once to be viewed by the reader another was the great clock powered by the earth's gravitational pull on revolutionary war cannonballs louis leschot a machinist aided jefferson with the clock jefferson invented a 6&#160in (15&#160cm) long coded wooden cipher wheel mounted on a metal spindle to keep state department messages secure while he was secretary of state the messages were scrambled and unscrambled by 26 alphabet letters on each circular segment of the wheel he improved the moldboard plow an idea he never patented and gave to posterity[340] and the polygraph in collaboration with charles willson peale[341] as minister to france jefferson was impressed by france's military standardization program known as the syst�me gribeauval as president he initiated a program at the federal armories to develop interchangeable parts for firearms he made improvements and introduced innovations on an english printing press he had brought back with him he also improved the pedometer a device for counting the number of steps taken while walking and gave one to james madison for jefferson's inventiveness and ingenuity he received several honorary doctor of law degrees[342] jefferson can also be accredited as the creator of the swivel chair the first of which he created and used to write much of the declaration of independence[343]
