early life and career william jefferson blythe iii in 1950 at age four clinton's boyhood home in hope arkansas clinton was born william jefferson blythe iii on august 19 1946 at julia chester hospital in hope arkansas[2][3] his father william jefferson blythe jr (1918�1946) was a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before clinton was born[4] his mother virginia dell (n�e cassidy 1923�1994) traveled to new orleans to study nursing soon after he was born she left clinton in hope with her parents eldridge and edith cassidy who owned and ran a small grocery store[3] at a time when the southern united states was segregated racially clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races[3] in 1950 bill's mother returned from nursing school and married roger clinton sr who owned an automobile dealership in hot springs arkansas with his brother and earl t ricks[3] the family moved to hot springs in 1950
although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname it was not until clinton turned fifteen[5] that he formally adopted the surname clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather[3] clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother roger clinton jr to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them[3][6]
in hot springs clinton attended st john's catholic elementary school ramble elementary school and hot springs high school&#160� where he was an active student leader avid reader and musician[3] clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section he briefly considered dedicating his life to music but as he noted in his autobiography my life
sometime in my sixteenth year i decided i wanted to be in public life as an elected official i loved music and thought i could be very good but i knew i would never be john coltrane or stan getz i was interested in medicine and thought i could be a fine doctor but i knew i would never be michael debakey but i knew i could be great in public service[3]
clinton's interest in law also began in hot springs high when in his latin class he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient roman senator catiline in a mock trial[7] after a vigorous defense that made use of his budding rhetorical and political skills he told the latin teacher elizabeth buck that it made him realize that someday he would study law[8]
clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure both occurring in 1963 one was his visit as a boys nation senator to the white house to meet president john f kennedy[3][6] the other was listening to martin luther king jr's 1963 i have a dream speech which impressed him enough that he later memorized it[9]
college and law school years georgetown university clinton ran for president of the student council while attending the school of foreign service at georgetown university with the aid of scholarships clinton attended the edmund a walsh school of foreign service at georgetown university in washington dc receiving a bachelor of science in foreign service (bs) degree in 1968 in 1964 and 1965 he won elections for class president[10] from 1964 to 1967 he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of arkansas senator j william fulbright[3] while in college he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity alpha phi omega[11] and was elected to phi beta kappa clinton was also a member of the order of demolay[12] a youth group affiliated with freemasonry but he never became a freemason he is a member of kappa kappa psi honorary band fraternity[13]
rhodes scholar upon graduation he won a rhodes scholarship to university college oxford where he studied philosophy politics and economics though because he had switched programs and had left early for yale university he did not receive a degree there[6][14][15] he developed an interest in rugby union playing at oxford[16] and later for the little rock rugby club in arkansas[citation needed]
vietnam war opposition and draft controversy while at oxford he also participated in vietnam war protests and organized an october 1969 moratorium to end the war in vietnam event[3]
clinton received vietnam war draft deferments during 1968 and 1969 while he was in england[17] planning to attend law school in the us and aware that he might lose his draft deferment he tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the national guard or air force and then made arrangements to join the reserve officers' training corps (rotc) program at the university of arkansas[18]
he subsequently decided not to join the rotc saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program he had planned to join that he opposed the war but did not think it was honorable to use rotc national guard or reserve service to avoid serving in vietnam he further stated that because he opposed the war he would not volunteer to serve in uniform but would subject himself to the draft and would serve if selected only as a way to maintain my political viability within the system[19] clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311) meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him which was unlikely clinton's political opponents charge that he used fulbright's influence to avoid military service[20] colonel eugene holmes the army officer who had been involved with clinton's rotc application suspected that clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform he issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign
i was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to senator fulbright's office that bill clinton a rhodes scholar should be admitted to the rotc program&#160� i believe that he purposely deceived me using the possibility of joining the rotc as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification[21]
during the 1992 campaign it was revealed that clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the navy reserve which would have kept him from going to vietnam this effort was unsuccessful and clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then[22] although legal clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized by conservatives and some vietnam veterans during his first presidential campaign[23] clinton's 1992 campaign manager james carville successfully argued that clinton's letter in which he declined to join the rotc should be made public insisting that voters many of whom had also opposed the vietnam war would understand and appreciate his position[24]
law school after oxford clinton attended yale law school and earned a juris doctor (jd) degree in 1973[3][6] in the yale law library in 1971 he met fellow law student hillary rodham who was a year ahead of him[3][25] they began dating and soon were inseparable after only about a month clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the george mcgovern campaign for the 1972 united states presidential election in order to move in with her in california[26] they married on october 11 1975 and their only child chelsea was born on february 27 1980[25]
clinton did eventually move to texas with rodham to take a job leading george mcgovern's effort there in 1972 he spent considerable time in dallas at the campaign's local headquarters on lemmon avenue where he had an office clinton worked with future two-term mayor of dallas ron kirk future governor of texas ann richards and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) steven spielberg[citation needed]

winning the big prizes of florida and texas and many of the southern primaries on super tuesday gave clinton a sizable delegate lead however former california governor jerry brown was scoring victories and clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native south[6][44] with no major southern state remaining clinton targeted new york which had many delegates he scored a resounding victory in new york city shedding his image as a regional candidate[44] having been transformed into the consensus candidate he secured the democratic party nomination finishing with a victory in jerry brown's home state of california[6]
clinton family in the white house during the campaign questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful rose law firm at which hillary rodham clinton was a partner arose clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining hillary's firm pay[3][56] further concern arose when bill clinton announced that with hillary voters would be getting two presidents for the price of one[57]
while campaigning for us president the then governor clinton returned to arkansas to see that ricky ray rector would be executed after killing a police officer and a civilian rector shot himself in the head leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death according to arkansas state and federal law a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed the courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution clinton's return to arkansas for the execution was framed in a the new york times article as a possible political move to counter soft on crime accusations[37][58]
because bush's approval ratings were around 80&#160percent during the gulf war he was described as unbeatable however when bush compromised with democrats to try to lower federal deficits he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes hurting his approval rating clinton repeatedly condemned bush for making a promise he failed to keep[44] by election time the economy was souring and bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40&#160percent[44][59] finally conservatives were previously united by anti-communism but with the end of the cold war the party lacked a uniting issue when pat buchanan and pat robertson addressed christian themes at the republican national convention&#160� with bush criticizing democrats for omitting god from their platform&#160� many moderates were alienated[60] clinton then pointed to his moderate new democrat record as governor of arkansas though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious[61] many democrats who had supported ronald reagan and bush in previous elections switched their support to clinton[62] clinton and his running mate al gore toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign shoring up support and pledging a new beginning[62]
