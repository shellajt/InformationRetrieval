early life jimmy carter (around age 13) with his dog bozo in 1937 carter was born on october 1 1924 at the wise sanatorium in plains georgia[note 1] he is a descendant of english immigrant thomas carter who settled in virginia in 1635 numerous generations of carters lived as cotton farmers in georgia established in sumter county plains was a boomtown of 600 people when carter was born carter's father james earl carter sr was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and had begun to invest in farmland he had been a reserve second lieutenant in the us army's quartermaster corps during world war i carter's mother bessie lillian gordy was a nurse at the wise hospital carter was the first of earl and lillian's children they moved several times during his infancy[2]
the carters settled on a dirt road in nearby archery which was almost entirely populated by impoverished african american families they eventually had three more children�gloria ruth and billy carter got along well with his parents although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood although earl was staunchly pro-segregation he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children an enterprising teenager carter was given his own acre of earl's farmland where he grew packaged and sold peanuts carter also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased[2]
carter attended the plains high school from 1930 first grade to 1941 the great depression had by then impoverished archery and plains but the family benefited from new deal farming subsidies and earl took a position as a community leader young carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading[note 2] carter's teacher julia coleman was an especially strong influence as an adolescent carter played on the plains high school basketball team he also joined the future farmers of america and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking[3]
naval career carter had long dreamed of attending the us naval academy in annapolis meanwhile he enrolled at georgia southwestern college in nearby americus after taking additional mathematics courses at georgia tech he was finally admitted to the naval academy in 1943 with his diminutive stature carter barely met the minimum physical requirements for entry he was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen while at the academy carter fell in love with his sister ruth's friend rosalynn smith whom he would marry shortly after his graduation in 1946[4] carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 and was commissioned as an ensign[5] from 1946 to 1953 carter and rosalynn lived temporarily in virginia hawaii connecticut and california as he served deployments in the atlantic and pacific fleets[6] promoted to a ltjg he completed qualification for command of a diesel-electric submarine in late 1952 he was admitted to the us navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program led by then-captain hyman g rickover rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary and carter later said that next to his parents rickover was the greatest influence on his life[7]
on december 12 1952 an accident with the experimental nrx reactor at atomic energy of canada's chalk river laboratories caused a partial meltdown the resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement and the reactor's core was no longer usable[8] carter was ordered to chalk river to lead a us maintenance crew that joined other american and canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor[9] the painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor during and after his presidency carter said that his experience at chalk river had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a neutron bomb[10]
carter took non-credit classes at union college in schenectady new york in 1953[6] upon the death of his father that july the family business became his but deciding to leave schenectady proved difficult rosalynn had also grown comfortable with their life returning to small-town life in plains seemed a monumental step backward she said later on the other hand carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's thus resigning his commission carter was honorably discharged from the navy on october 9 1953[11][12]
farming earl carter died a relatively wealthy man having also recently been elected to the georgia house of representatives however between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs his son jimmy inherited comparatively little for a year jimmy rosalynn and their three sons lived in public housing in plains carter is the only us president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects however carter set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business the transition from navy to agribusinessman was difficult as the harvest his first year failed due to drought carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat meanwhile he also took classes and read up on agriculture while rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books though they barely broke even the first year the carters grew the business and became quite successful[13][14]
early political career 1963�71 georgia state senator (1963�67) racial tension was inflamed in plains by the 1954 us supreme court's anti-segregation ruling in brown v board of education carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integration�at one point the local white citizens' council boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join them�but he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies by 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the baptist church as well as chairman of the sumter county school board where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration[15] a state senate seat was opened by the dissolution of georgia's county unit system in 1962 carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election rosalynn who had an instinct for politics and organization was instrumental to his campaign the initial results showed carter losing but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by joe hurst the sheriff of quitman county carter challenged the results when fraud was confirmed a new election was held which he won[16]
the civil rights movement was well underway as carter took office he and his family had become staunch john f kennedy supporters in 1962 the town of americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters echoing similar unrest throughout the country carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first even as it polarized much of the county to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues he did speak up on a few divisive issues giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the georgia constitution which he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion[17] a diligent legislator carter took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload within two years his connections landed him on the state democratic executive committee where he helped rewrite the state party's rules he became chairman of the west central georgia planning and development commission which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration when bo callaway was elected to the us house of representatives in november 1964 carter immediately began planning to unseat him the two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state carter wanted it to go to georgia southwestern college in americus but callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown columbus carter saw callaway a republican as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics[18]
carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term for a time in the state senate he chaired its education committee he also sat on the appropriations committee toward the end of his second term before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting georgia southwestern a four-year program he leveraged his regional planning work giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters the last day of the term he announced his run for congress[19]
1966 and 1970 campaigns for governor see also georgia gubernatorial election 1966 and georgia gubernatorial election 1970 the congressional race was shaken up in mid-may when callaway dropped out and decided to run for governor of georgia instead callaway was a very strong candidate and state democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since reconstruction carter soon decided to follow callaway and run for governor himself in the democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor ellis arnall and the conservative lester maddox in a press conference he described his ideology as conservative moderate liberal and middle-of-the-road  i believe i am a more complicated person than that[20] he lost the democratic primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force arnall into a runoff election with maddox a chain of events then resulted in maddox the dark horse candidate being elected governor[note 3] the result was a sharp blow to carter who was left deeply in debt his attempt to rescue the race from callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist maddox which he considered an even worse outcome[21]
carter returned to his agriculture business and during the next four years carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970 this period was a spiritual turning point for carter he grew increasingly evangelical undertaking several religious missions in other states inspired by his sister ruth and liberal theologians such as reinhold niebuhr he declared himself born again a growing movement in 1960s america his last child amy was born around this time[22][23]
the liberal former governor carl sanders was carter's main opponent in the 1970 democratic primary carter ran a more modern campaign this time around employing printed graphics and statistical analysis responding to poll data carter leaned more conservative than before he positioned himself as a populist quickly going negative against sanders for his wealth (labeling him cufflinks carl) and associating him with the national democratic party he accused sanders of corruption but when pressed by the media could come up with no evidence[24][25] throughout the campaign carter sought both the black vote and the wallace vote after the prominent segregationist george wallace while he met with black figures such as martin luther king sr and andrew young and visited many black-owned businesses he also praised wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in georgia he implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience the appeal to racism became more blatant over time carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent sanders celebrating with black basketball players[24][25]
that september carter came ahead of sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent leading to a runoff the campaign grew even more bitter carter's campaign criticized sanders for supporting martin luther king jr carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote�winning 7 percent of the black vote�and went on to win the general election easily over the republican hal suit a local news anchor once he was elected carter began to speak confidently against georgia's racist politics leroy johnson a black state senator voiced his support for carter saying i understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign  i don't believe you can win this state without being a racist[24]
governor of georgia (1971�75) carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of georgia on january 12 1971 he declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial segregation was over no poor rural weak or black person should ever again have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education a job or simple justice the crowd was reportedly shocked by this message contrasting starkly with georgia's political culture and particularly carter's campaign the many segregationists who had supported carter during the race felt betrayed time magazine ran a story on the progressive new south governors elected that year in a may 1971 issue featuring a cover illustration of carter[26][27][28]
lester maddox carter's predecessor as governor became lieutenant governor carter had endorsed maddox although the two did not campaign as a ticket the two found little common ground during their four years of service often publicly feuding with each other[29] richard russell jr then president pro tempore of the united states senate died in office during carter's second week in office the newly inaugurated governor appointed david h gambrell state democratic party chair to fill russell's unexpired term in the senate[30]
with carter's reluctance to engage in back-slapping and political favors the legislature found him frustrating to work with[31][32] he looked to aggressively expand the governor's authority while reducing the complexity of the state government therefore he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it he implemented zero-based budgeting within state departments and added a judicial selection commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor[31] the reorganization plan was submitted in january 1972 but had a cool reception in the legislature after two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session[33] ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22�a fact he would emphasize in his presidential run�although it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so[34]
civil rights were a heartfelt priority for carter he expanded the number of black state employees judges and board members he hired rita jackson samuels a black woman to advise him on potential appointments[35] he placed portraits of martin luther king jr and two other prominent black georgians in the capitol building even as the ku klux klan picketed the unveiling ceremony[36] still carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable he co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with george wallace at the 1971 national governors conference[35] after the us supreme court threw out georgia's death penalty statute in furman v georgia (1972) carter signed a revised death penalty statute which addressed the court's objections thus re-introducing the practice in the state carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty saying i didn't see the injustice of it as i do now[37]
carter pushed reforms through the legislature to provide equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of georgia set up community centers for mentally handicapped children and increased educational programs for convicts he took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials under this program all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence[38][39]
in one of his more controversial decisions[40] he vetoed a plan to build a dam on georgia's flint river after surveying the river and the literature himself he argued that the us army corps of engineers was underestimating both the project's cost and its impact on the region the veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide[36] when lieutenant william calley was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the my lai massacre in south vietnam a politically polarizing issue carter avoided paying direct tribute to calley he instead instituted american fighting man's day and asked georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military[41]
national ambition looking toward a potential presidential run carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances he was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 democratic national convention where the liberal us senator george mcgovern was the likely presidential nominee carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative anti-mcgovern voters so that the convention would consider him for mcgovern's running mate on a compromise ticket he endorsed senator henry scoop jackson in part to distance himself from george wallace carter was still fairly obscure at the time and his attempt at triangulation failed the 1972 democratic ticket went to mcgovern and senator thomas eagleton[42]
after mcgovern's loss in november 1972 carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff he had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid together he tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the national governors association to boost his visibility on david rockefeller's endorsement he was named to the trilateral commission in april 1973 the following year he was named chairman of the democratic national committee's congressional as well as gubernatorial campaigns[43] in 1973 he appeared on the game show what's my line where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation none recognized him and it took several rounds of question-and-answer before movie critic gene shalit correctly guessed he was a governor[44]
1976 presidential campaign main articles democratic party (united states) presidential primaries 1976 and united states presidential election 1976 the electoral map of the 1976 election when carter entered the democratic party presidential primaries in 1976 he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians his name recognition was two percent as the watergate scandal of president nixon was still fresh in the voters' minds carter's position as an outsider distant from washington dc became an asset he promoted government reorganization carter published why not the best in june 1976 to help introduce himself to the american public[45]
carter and president gerald ford debating at the walnut street theatre in philadelphia carter became the front-runner early on by winning the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary he used a two-prong strategy in the south which most had tacitly conceded to alabama's george wallace carter ran as a moderate favorite son when wallace proved to be a spent force carter swept the region in the north carter appealed largely to conservative christian and rural voters he had little chance of winning a majority in most states he won several northern states by building the largest single bloc carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there he had traveled over 50000 miles visited 37 states and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates announced that they were in the race[46] initially dismissed as a regional candidate carter proved to be the only democrat with a truly national strategy and he clinched the nomination[citation needed]
the national news media discovered and promoted carter as lawrence shoup noted in his 1980 book the carter presidency and beyond
what carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media it was their favorable coverage of carter and his campaign that gave him an edge propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls this helped carter win key primary election victories enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to president-elect in the short space of 9 months[47]
carter was interviewed by robert scheer of playboy for the november 1976 issue which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election while discussing his religion's view of pride carter said i've looked on a lot of women with lust i've committed adultery in my heart many times[48] he is the only interviewee of playboy to become us president[49]
as late as january 26 1976 carter was the first choice of only four percent of democratic voters according to a gallup poll[citation needed] yet by mid-march 1976 carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the democratic presidential nomination he also led president ford by a few percentage points according to shoup[50]
he chose senator walter f mondale as his running mate he attacked washington in his speeches and offered a religious salve for the nation's wounds[51]
carter began the race with a sizable lead over ford who narrowed the gap during the campaign but lost to carter in a narrow defeat on november 2 1976 carter won the popular vote by 501 percent to 480 percent for ford and received 297 electoral votes to ford's 240 carter became the first contender from the deep south to be elected president since the 1848 election carter carried fewer states than ford�23 states to the defeated ford's 27�yet carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote (501 percent) of any non-incumbent since dwight eisenhower[citation needed]

carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world most visibly in the middle east with the signing of the camp david accords giving back the panama canal and signing the salt ii nuclear arms reduction treaty with soviet leader leonid brezhnev his final year was marred by the iran hostage crisis which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to ronald reagan[54] there is strong evidence that he supported and helped to instigate the iran�iraq war[55]
