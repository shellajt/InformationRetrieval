in office wilson reintroduced the spoken state of the union which had been out of use since 1801 leading the congress now in democratic hands he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the new deal in 1933[1] included among these were the federal reserve act federal trade commission act the clayton antitrust act and the federal farm loan act having taken office one month after ratification of the sixteenth amendment wilson called a special session of congress whose work culminated in the revenue act of 1913 reintroducing an income tax and lowering tariffs through passage of the adamson act imposing an 8-hour workday for railroads he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis[2] upon the outbreak of world war i in 1914 wilson maintained a policy of neutrality while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with mexico's civil war
wilson faced former united states supreme court associate justice charles evans hughes of new york in the presidential elections of 1916 and became the first democrat since andrew jackson elected to consecutive terms he was narrowly re-elected on the slogan he kept us out of war wilson's second term however was dominated by american entry into world war i in april 1917 when germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare wilson asked congress to declare war in order to make the world safe for democracy the united states conducted military operations alongside the allies although without a formal alliance during the war wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations leaving military strategy to the generals especially general john j pershing loaning billions of dollars to britain france and other allies the united states aided their finance of the war effort through the selective service act conscription sent 10000 freshly trained soldiers to france per day by summer of 1918 on the home front he raised income taxes borrowing billions of dollars through the public's purchase of liberty bonds he set up the war industries board promoted labor union cooperation regulating agriculture and food production through the lever act and granting to the secretary of the treasury william mcadoo direct control of the nation's railroad system

early life wilson c mid 1870s wilson was born in staunton virginia on december&#16028 1856 at 1824 north coalter street (now the woodrow wilson presidential library) of scots-irish descent[9] he was the third of four children of joseph ruggles wilson (18221903) and jessie janet woodrow (18261888)[10] wilson's paternal grandparents immigrated to the united states from strabane county tyrone ireland (now northern ireland) in 1807 his mother was born in carlisle cumberland england the daughter of rev dr thomas woodrow from paisley scotland and marion williamson from glasgow[11] this was one of the border counties which supplied many immigrants to the north american colonies in the late 18th century
joseph originally lived in steubenville ohio where his family had settled wilson's grandfather had published a pro-tariff and anti-slavery newspaper the western herald and gazette[12] wilson's parents moved south in 1851 and came to fully identify with it his father defended slavery owned slaves and set up a sunday school for them both parents identified with the confederacy they cared for wounded soldiers at their church and wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the confederate army[13] woodrow wilson's earliest memory from the age of three was of hearing that abraham lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at general robert e lee's side and looking up into his face[13]
wilson's father was one of the founders of the southern presbyterian church in the united states (pcus) in 1861 after it split from the northern presbyterians he served as the first permanent clerk of the southern church's general assembly was stated clerk from 1865 to 1898 and was moderator of the pcus general assembly in 1879 he became minister of the first presbyterian church in augusta georgia and the family lived there until young wilson was 14[14][14] wilson in 1873 formally became a member of the columbia first presbyterian church and remained a member throughout his life[15]
education wilson's reading began at age ten possibly delayed by dyslexia he later blamed the lack of schools in the postbellum south as a teen he taught himself the graham shorthand system to compensate and achieved academically with self-discipline studying at home with his father then in classes at a small augusta school[16] during reconstruction wilson lived in columbia south carolina from 1870 to 1874 while his father was professor at the columbia theological seminary[17] his father moved the family to wilmington north carolina in 1874 where he was the minister at first presbyterian church until 1882 wilson attended davidson college in north carolina for the 187374 school year cut short by illness then transferred to princeton as a freshman when his father began teaching at the university he graduated in 1879 a member of phi kappa psi fraternity in his second year he studied political philosophy and history was active in the whig literary and debating society and wrote for the nassau literary review[18] he organized the liberal debating society[19] and later coached the whigclio debate panel[20] in the hotly contested election of 1876 wilson declared his support for the democratic party and its nominee samuel j tilden[21]
in 1879 wilson attended law school at the university of virginia for one year he was involved in the virginia glee club and was president of the jefferson literary and debating society[22] while there he enjoyed frequent trips to his birthplace of staunton he visited with cousins and fell in love with one hattie woodrow though his affections were unrequited[23]
his health became frail and dictated withdrawal so he went home to his parents then living in wilmington north carolina where he continued his law studies[24] wilson was admitted to the georgia bar and made a brief attempt at law practice in january&#1601882 he found legal history and substantive jurisprudence interesting but abhorred the day-to-day procedural aspects after less than a year he abandoned the practice to pursue his study of political science and history both parents expressed concern over a potentially premature decision[25]
ellen axson wilson (1883) in the fall of april&#1601883 wilson entered johns hopkins university to study history political science and the german language[26] three years later he completed his doctoral dissertation congressional government a study in american politics[27] and received a phd[28]
marriage and family in late spring of 1883 wilson was summoned to rome georgia to assist in the settlement of his maternal uncle william's estate which was being mishandled by a brother-in-law while there he met and fell in love with ellen louise axson the daughter of a minister from savannah georgia he proposed to her and they became engaged in asheville[29]
wilson's marriage to ellen was delayed by traumatic developments in her family in late 1883 ellen's father edward suffering from depression was admitted to the georgia state mental hospital where in 1884 he committed suicide after closing the family home in rome georgia and recovering from the initial shock ellen gained admission to the art students league of new york after graduation she pursued portrait art and received a medal for one of her works from the paris international exposition she happily agreed to sacrifice further independent artistic pursuits in order to keep her marriage commitment and in 1885 she and wilson married[30]
personal interests wilson was an automobile enthusiast and took daily rides while he was president in his favorite car a 1919 pierce-arrow[31] his enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for public highways[32] wilson was an avid baseball fan and in 1915 became the first sitting president to attend and throw out the first ball at a world series game wilson had been a center fielder during his davidson college days and was the princeton team's assistant manager[33] he cycled regularly taking several cycling vacations in the english lake district[34] wilson later took up golf[35]
academic career daughters jessie and margaret daughter eleanor wilson worked as a lecturer at cornell university in 188687 where he joined the irving literary society he next taught at bryn mawr college from 1885 until 1888 teaching ancient greek and roman history while there he refused offers from the universities of michigan and indiana[36] when ellen was pregnant with their first child in 1886 the couple decided that ellen should go to her aunt louisa brown's residence in gainesville georgia to have their first child she arrived just one day before the baby margaret was born in april&#1601886 their second child jessie was born in august&#1601887[37]
in 1888 wilson left bryn mawr for wesleyan university it was a controversial move as he had signed a three-year contract with bryn mawr in 1887 both parties claimed contract violations and the matter subsided[38] at wesleyan he coached the football team and founded the debate team which bears his name[39]
in february&#1601890 with the help of friends wilson was elected by the princeton university board to the chair of jurisprudence and political economy at an annual salary of $3000[40] he continued a previous practice of reserving time for a six-week course in administration at johns hopkins[41] he was also a faculty member of the short-lived coordinate college evelyn college for women additionally wilson became the first lecturer of constitutional law at new york law school where he taught with charles evans hughes[42] representing the american whig society wilson delivered an oration at princeton's sesquicentennial celebration (1896) entitled princeton in the nation's service which was the origin for the school's motto[43] wilson became annoyed that princeton was not living up to its potential complaining there's a little college down in kentucky which in 60 years has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has princeton in her 150 years[44]
political science author us democratic republic and british parliament contrast wilson a disciple of walter bagehot considered the united states constitution to be cumbersome and open to corruption wilson favored a parliamentary system for the united states and in the early 1880s wrote i ask you to put this question to yourselves should we not draw the executive and legislature closer together should we not on the one hand give the individual leaders of opinion in congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president and the president on the other hand a better chance to approve himself a statesman and his advisers capable men of affairs in the guidance of congress[45]
wilson's first political work congressional government (1885) advocated a parliamentary system he critically described the united states government with frequent negative comparisons to westminster critics contended the book was written without the benefit of the author observing any operational aspect of the us congress and supporters asserted the work was the product of the imagination of a future statesman the book reflected the greater power of the legislature relative to the executive during the post-bellum period[46] wilson later became a regular contributor to political science quarterly an academic journal[47]
wilson's second publication in 1890 was a textbook entitled the state used widely in college courses throughout the country until the 1920s he argued that government should not be deemed evil and advocated the use of government to allay social ills and advance society's welfare[48] in 1889 wilson contributed to a us historical series covering the period from pres jackson through reconstruction his third book entitled division and reunion was published in 1893 and considered an outstanding contribution to american historical writing[49] wilson's fourth publication a five-volume work entitled history of the american people was the culmination of a series of articles written for harper's and was published in 1902[50] in 1899 wilson wrote in the state that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare by forbidding child labor by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades [and] by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out-do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry[51]
wilson believed that america's system of checks and balances complicated american governance if government behaved badly wilson queried how is the schoolmaster the nation to know which boy needs the whipping[52] wilson singled out the united states house of representatives for particular criticism saying
 divided up as it were into forty-seven seignories in each of which a standing committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor these petty barons some of them not a little powerful but none of them within reach [of] the full powers of rule may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself[53]
in his last scholarly work constitutional government of the united states (1908) wilson said that the presidency will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it by the time of his presidency wilson hoped that presidents could be party leaders in the same way british prime ministers were wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological not geographic lines he wrote eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties no leaders no principles no principles no parties[54]
wilson also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and made the imperative legal duty of the whole a position which according to robert m saunders seemed to indicate that wilson was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state[55]
public administration wilson also studied public administration which he called government in action it is the executive the operative the most visible side of government and is of course as old as government itself[56] he believed that the study of public administration could enable officials to increase governmental efficiency[57] he faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere practical detail he thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations by his day he thought it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one[58] he thought it time to straighten the paths of government to make its business less unbusinesslike to strengthen and purify its organization and it to crown its dutifulness[59] he summarized the growth of such foreign states as prussia france and england highlighting the events that led to advances in administration
by contrast he thought the united states required greater compromise because of the diversity of public opinion and the difficulty of forming a majority opinion thus practical reform to the government was necessarily slow yet wilson insisted that administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics[60] and that general laws which direct these things to be done are as obviously outside of and above administration[61] he likened administration to a machine that functions independent of the changing mood of its leaders such a line of demarcation is intended to focus responsibility for actions taken on the people or persons in charge as wilson put it public attention must be easily directed in each case of good or bad administration to just the man deserving of praise or blame there is no danger in power if only it be not irresponsible if it be divided dealt out in share to many it is obscured[62] essentially the items under the discretion of administration must be limited in scope as to not block nullify obfuscate or modify the implementation of governmental decree made by the executive branch
president of princeton university wilson  princeton's president (1902) wilson had in the past been offered the presidency at the university of illinois in 1892 and at the university of virginia in 1901 both of which he declined[63] the princeton trustees promoted professor wilson to president in june&#1601902 replacing francis landey patton whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator[63]
although the school's endowment was barely $4&#160million wilson sought $2&#160million for a preceptorial system of teaching $1&#160million for a school of science and nearly $3&#160million for new buildings and salary increases as a long-term objective wilson sought $3&#160million for a graduate school and $25&#160million for schools of jurisprudence and electrical engineering as well as a museum of natural history[64] he increased the faculty from 112 to 174 most of whom he selected himself on the basis of their records as outstanding teachers the curriculum guidelines he developed proved important progressive innovations in the field of higher education[65] wilson also made biblical studies a scholarly pursuit appointed the first jew and the first roman catholic to the faculty and helped liberate the board from domination by conservative presbyterians[66]
to emphasize the development of expertise wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements students were to meet for these in groups of six with preceptors followed by two years of concentration in a selected major he tried to raise admission standards and to replace the gentleman's c with serious study wilson aspired as he told alumni to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men[67]
in 1906 wilson awoke to find himself blind in the left eye the result of a blood clot and hypertension modern medical opinion surmises wilson had suffered a strokehe later was diagnosed as his father had been with hardening of the arteries he took a bermuda vacation he began to exhibit his father's traits of impatience and intolerance which would on occasion lead to errors of judgment[68] in 1896 wilson had somewhat prophetically described his problem in the sesquicentennial speech at princeton your thorough presbyterian is not subject to the ordinary laws of life is of too stubborn a fiber too unrelaxing a purpose to suffer mere inconvenience to bring defeat[66]
prospect house wilson's home on princeton's campus when wilson began vacationing in bermuda in 1906 he met a socialite mary hulbert peck their visits together became a regular occurrence on his return wilson in his letters home to ellen openly related these gatherings as well his other social events according to biographer august heckscher ellen could sense a problem and it became the topic of frank discussion between them wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair but wilson did on one occasion write a musing in shorthandon the reverse side of a draft for an editorial my precious one my beloved mary[69] wilson also sent very personal letters which would be used against him by his adversaries later[70]
on another occasion while wilson was vacationing solo in the british isles ellen journeyed to connecticut she joined the household of respected artist florence griswold to further pursue her own interests[71]
during his time at princeton he attempted to curtail the influence of social elites by abolishing the upper-class eating clubs he proposed moving the students into colleges also known as quadrangles wilson's quad plan was met with fierce opposition from princeton's alumni wilson persisted saying that giving in would be to temporize with evil[72] in october&#1601907 due to the intensity of alumni opposition the board of trustees withdrew its support for the quad plan and instructed wilson to withdraw it[73] not long afterward wilson suffered a recurrence of his 1906 ailment as before a vacation was prescribed and proved beneficial[71]
late in his tenure wilson had a confrontation with andrew fleming west dean of the graduate school and also west's ally ex-president grover cleveland who was a trustee wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the campus core while west preferred a more distant campus site in 1909 wilson's final year at princeton began with a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campus the acceptance of this condition by the board was a pivotal defeat for wilson[74] the national press covered the confrontation as a battle between the elites represented by west versus the populists represented by wilson
from its outset wilson became disenchanted with resistance to his recommendations at princeton he ruminated on future political leadership prior to the democratic presidential nominating convention in 1908 wilson had dropped hints to some influential players in the democratic party of his interest in the democratic ticket while he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket he did leave instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination and then he was off for a vacation in scotland party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful but the seeds had been sown[75] wilson later commented that politics was less brusque than university administration[76]
wilson was elected president of the american political science association in 1910 but soon decided to leave his princeton post and enter new jersey state politics[77] mcgeorge bundy in 1956 described wilson's contribution to princeton wilson was right in his conviction that princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men it has been more ever since his time[78]
governor of new jersey gov wilson 1911 in january&#1601910 wilson had drawn the attention of new jersey's us senator james smith jr and george harvey as the potential democratic standard bearer in the upcoming gubernatorial election on july&#16012 1910 he was introduced to new jersey's power players at the lawyers club in new york including james richard nugent robert s hudspeth millard f ross and richard v lindabury the bosses had chosen their man but his nomination was not a givenmany including organized labor felt wilson was an inexperienced newcomer[79] nevertheless the bosses marshaled their forces at the party convention and on september&#16014 wilson was nominated this despite his endorsement of the local option on the liquor issuein opposition to the political machine he submitted his letter of resignation to princeton on october&#16020[80]
wilson's opponent in the general election was the republican candidate vivian m lewis the state commissioner of banking and insurance wilson's campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses wilson quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented himself as a full-fledged progressive[81] he soundly defeated lewis by a margin of more than 650000 votes although republican william howard taft had carried new jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82000 votes[82][83] historian edmund morris called wilson in the governor's race a dark horse he attributed his and others' success against the taft republicans in 1910 in part to the emergent national progressive message enunciated by theodore roosevelt in his post-presidency[84]
in the 1910 election the democrats also took control of the general assembly though the state senate remained in republican hands wilson appointed joseph patrick tumulty as his private secretary a position he held throughout wilson's political career[85] he began formulating his reformist agenda intending to ignore the demands of party machinery after wilson's election political boss us senator smith asked wilson to endorse his own reelection bid in the state legislature (this was before popular election of senators) wilson refused and endorsed smith's opponent james e martine when martine won the seat wilson had manifestly positioned himself as a new leader in the party in that state[86]
wilson concentrated on four major state reformschanges in the election laws a corrupt practices act workmen's compensation and establishment of a commission to regulate utilities the geran bill drafted by del elmer h geran expanded public participation in primaries for all offices including party officials and delegates it was thus directed at the power of the political bosses it passed the state assembly albeit by a narrow margin the corrupt practices law and workmen's compensation statute soon followed[87]
presidential election of 1912 main article united states presidential election 1912 democratic nomination wilson's prominence as governor and in the national media induced his presidential campaign in 1912 wilson committed himself to try for the democratic nomination in march of the prior year when he spoke at an atlanta meeting of the southern commercial congress afterwards he said&#160 i was given a dinner breakfast and reception and on every possible occasion was nominated for the presidency[88] while wilson was in atlanta his wife ellen alert that key democrat william jennings bryan was visiting princeton and recalling wilson's opposition to him in 1896 invited him for dinner upon wilson's return indeed the establishment of rapport with bryan the most recent standard bearer of the party was a success[89]
champ clark wilson's foremost opponent for the democratic nomination william jennings bryan shifted his support from clark to wilson and ushered in the nomination wilson began a truly public campaign for the nomination in the south with a speech to the pewter platter club in norfolk va while he was received enthusiastically the speech reformist in nature was considered provocative and radical by the conservative audience making the visit on the whole less than positive[90] with wilson the first southerner to have a serious chance at the white house since 1848 however southern democrats in general strongly supported wilson's campaign for the nomination in 1912[91] more of wilson's support came from young progressives in that region including intellectuals editors and lawyers wilson managed to maneuver through the complexities of local politics for example in tennessee the democratic party was divided over prohibition wilson was progressive and sober but not dry and appealed to both sides they united behind him to win the presidential election in the state but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election[92]
after norfolk wilson then proceeded westward to kansas colorado california oregon and washington he favored voting reforms which empowered the populace such as the initiative the referendum and the recall (excepting judges)[93] in california wilson was asked about his views on women's suffrage and though he was firmly opposed he evasively said that it was a matter for the states to decide[94]
in july&#1601911 wilson brought william gibbs mcadoo and edward mandell house in to manage the campaign[95] the 1912 democratic convention in baltimore was one of the most dramatic conventions in american history only the republican conventions of 1880 and 1940 and the democratic convention of 1952 are comparable[96] william f mccombs who helped wilson win the governorship served as convention chairman the republicans at their convention had set the stage a week earlier nominating incumbent william howard taft with theodore roosevelt stalking out to launch an independent campaign to split the party vote[97] wilson was convinced that the baltimore convention should be allowed to work its will without his interferenceso he went golfing and motoring as for his assistant tumulty he nearly collapsed under the strain[98]
the convention deadlocked for over forty ballotsno candidate could reach the two-thirds vote required the leading contender was house speaker champ clark a prominent progressive strongest in the border states other less charismatic contenders were governor judson harmon of ohio and representative oscar underwood of alabama publisher william randolph hearst a leader of the left wing of the party supported clark william jennings bryan the nominee in 1896 1900 and 1908 played a critical role in his declared opposition to any candidate supported by the financiers of wall street indeed on the tenth ballot new york's delegation went unanimously to clark and the battle lines were clearly drawn between the bosses and the rank and file delegates[99] bryan then announced on the fourteenth ballot that his vote for clark would be withheld due to the new york vote wilson's tally began to climb steadily and he initially topped clark's vote on the thirtieth ballot[100] bryan announced for wilson who ultimately won the nomination on the 46th ballot[101] wilson chose indiana governor thomas r marshall as his running mate[102]
general election wilson directed chairman of finance henry morgenthau not to accept contributions from corporations and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public and morgenthau succeeded admirably in order to further embolden democrats especially in new jersey and new york wilson set out to ensure the defeat of local candidates supported by machines who were running for re-electionjames smith jr (us senate in new jersey) and john dix (governor of new york) he succeeded in both of these efforts and thereby weakened arguments that party control resided with political bosses[103]
speeches in buffalo and new york city exemplified the pattern of wilson's speechmaking his oratory style was right out of my mind as it is working at the time he maintained towards his primary opponent roosevelt a tone of humorous detachment describing the bull moose party as the irregular republicans the variegated republicans wilson shunned the stump speech campaign routine and initially was reticent to conduct an extensive campaign tour but this changed after roosevelt went on the offensive[104]
1912 electoral vote map a notably progressive speech in minneapolis included the following that property as compared with humanity as compared with the vital red blood in the american people must take second place not first place[105] wilson frequently sought out louis d brandeis for advice on economic policythat corporate trusts be regulated by the government his campaign then increased its focus upon the elimination of monopoly in all forms wilson also concluded that major reforms in banking and a lower tariff were needed to eliminate the spheres of entrenched interests which distorted the functioning of the free-market[106] in indianapolis he said that for the next president there will be no greater burden in our generation than to organize the forces of liberty and to make conquest of a new freedom for america this serendipitous comment spawned the title of wilson's policy of new freedom emphasizing the lower tariffs and limited federal governmentalbeit with increased anti-trust law enforcement and creation of a new banking regulator the federal reserve system[107]
when roosevelt was wounded by an assassin wilson restricted his events to those already scheduled and limited his criticism to the regular republicans it was evident by this time that the wilson movement would not be checked[108] the gop split between taft and roosevelt enlarged wilson's success in the electoral college wilson appealed to african americans and promised to work for them gaining some support among them in the north at the expense of the republicans wilson took 418% of the popular vote and won 435 electoral votes from 40 states[109] it is not clear if roosevelt extracted more support from fellow republican taft or fellow progressive wilson[110]
presidency (19131921) first term 19131917 woodrow wilson after a vacation in bermuda wilson was energized and more aggressive even combative he noted the presidency was an office in which a man must put on his war paint in chicago he addressed the commercial club including some of the most powerful industrial and financial leaders of the midwest he unapologetically emphasized his progressivism and called his audience to account for their malpractices in business affairs[111]
woodrow wilson sworn in march&#1604 1913 in his inaugural address wilson reiterated his agenda for lower tariffs and banking reform as well as aggressive trust and labor legislation the wilsons decided against an inaugural ball and instead gathered with family and friends at the white house[112]
wilson's demand for private reflection was evident when he immediately announced that office seekers were not permitted to visit the white house his decision-making style was to use solitude in conjunction with prevailing opinions in making decisions[113] wilson's personal staff reflected his preferences tumultys position provided a political buffer and intermediary with the press and his irrepressible irish sentiment offset the president's often dour scotch disposition[114] another close member of his personal staff was his physician navy medical officer cary t grayson who familiarized himself with the president's medical history and confirmed the circulatory problem and hardening of the arteries[115]
wilson pioneered twice-weekly press conferences in the white house though they were modestly effective the president prohibited his being quoted and was particularly indeterminate in his statements[116] the first such press conference was on march&#16015 1913 when reporters were allowed to ask him questions[117] in 1913 he also became the first president to deliver the state of the union address in person since 1801 when thomas jefferson discontinued this practice
wilson the only democrat besides grover cleveland to be elected president since 1856 recognized his party's need for high-level federal patronage[118] wilson was also the first southerner elected to the white house since 1869 and worked closely with southern democrats in wilson's first month in office postmaster general albert s burleson and treasury secretary william g mcadoo permitted lower-level officials to racially segregate employees in those departments segregation in the federal government which had begun earlier now accelerated in accord with predominant public opinion[119] heckscher argues that wilson had indeed promised to deal generously with racial injustices but did not deliver on these assurances out of concern for his considerable legislative agenda[120]
wilson primes the economic pump with tariff currency and anti-trust laws 1913 in an early and instructive foreign policy matter wilson responded to an angry protest by the japanese when the state of california proposed legislation which excluded the japanese from land ownership in the state wilson was reticent to assert federal supremacy over the state's legislation there was talk of war and some argument within the cabinet for a show of naval force which wilson firmly rebuffed after diplomatic exchanges the scare subsided japan wanted a treaty (beyond the roottakahira agreement then in place) but none was negotiated japanese anger and humiliation remained high for this and other reasons for decades to come[121][122]
in implementing economic policy wilson had to transcend the sharply opposing policy views of the southern and agrarian wing of the democratic party led by bryan and the pro-business and northern wing led by urban political bossestammany in new york sullivan in chicago and smith and nugent in newark[123] in his columbia lectures of 1907 wilson had said the whole art of statesmanship is the art of bringing the several parts of government into effective cooperation for the accomplishment of particular common objects[123] as he took up the first item of his new freedom agendalowering the tariffshe quite adroitly applied this artistry with large democratic majorities in congress and a healthy economy he promptly seized the opportunity to effectuate his agenda[124] wilson also made quick work of realizing his pledges to beef up antitrust regulation and to bring reform to banking and currency matters[125]
while wilson was busy with his prodigious legislative agenda ellen spent the summer and fall months of 1913 in cornish nh where she reprised her painting and was quite delighted doing so she completed a number of new hampshire landscapes which matched or exceeded the skills she had displayed up to that time though wilson travelled to cornish for brief visits they both bemoaned their extended separation and frequently exchanged letters reflecting this and their affection for one another[126]
tariff legislation to facilitate reduction of the tariffs wilson garnered unexpected support from a previous rival oscar underwood chairman of the house ways and means committee and sen furnifold m simmons chairman of the senate finance committee[127] in may&#1601913 the underwood tariff passed in the house by a vote of 274 to 5 it would take a bit longer passing in the senatein septemberand was signed by wilson three weeks later[128] its effects were soon overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by world war i[129] wilson mobilized public opinion behind the tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists in an address to congress and by staging an elaborate signing ceremony[130] the revenue lost by the lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax authorized by the 16th amendment
federal reserve system map of federal reserve districtsblack circles federal reserve banksblack squares district branchesred circles and washington hqstar/black circle wilson had not waited for completion of the tariff legislation to proceed with his next item of reformbankingwhich he initiated in june&#1601913[131] after consulting with brandeis wilson declared the banking system must be public not private must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments not the masters of business[132] he tried to find a middle ground between conservative republicans led by senator nelson w aldrich and the powerful left wing of the democratic party led by william jennings bryan who strenuously denounced private banks and wall street the latter group wanted a government-owned central bank that could print paper money as congress required the compromise based on the aldrich plan but sponsored by democratic congressmen carter glass and robert owen allowed the private banks to control the 12 regional federal reserve banks but appeased the agrarians by placing controlling interest in the system in a central board appointed by the president with senate approval moreover wilson convinced bryan's supporters that because federal reserve notes were obligations of the government the plan met their demands for an elastic currency having 12 regional banks with designated geographic districts was meant to weaken the influence of the powerful new york banks a key demand of bryan's allies in the south and west and was a key factor in winning glass' support[133] the federal reserve act passed in december&#1601913[134]
wilson named paul warburg and other prominent bankers to direct the new system while power was supposed to be decentralized the new york branch dominated the fed as the first among equals[135] the new system began operations in 1915 and played a major role in financing the allied and american war effort[136] the strengthening of the federal reserve was later a major accomplishment of the new deal[137]

antitrust and other measures wilson began pushing for legislation which culminated with the federal trade commission act signed in september&#1601914 in doing so wilson broke with his predecessors' practice of litigating the antitrust issue in the courts known as trust-busting the new federal trade commission provided a new regulatory approach to encourage competition and reduce perceived unfair trade practices[139] in addition he pushed through congress the clayton antitrust act making certain business practices illegal such as price discrimination agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies' products and directorates and agreements to control other companies the power of this legislation was greater than that of previous anti-trust laws since it dictated accountability of individual corporate officers and clarified guidelines this law was considered the magna carta of labor by samuel gompers because it ended union liability antitrust laws in 1916 under threat of a national railroad strike wilson approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees there was no strike[140]
in the summer of 1914 wilson gained repeal of toll exemptions at the panama canal for american ships this was received positively by the international community as a cessation of past discrimination against foreign commerce the measure was considered unpatriotic by us business interests and opponents such as tammany hall[141]
with the president reaching out to new constituencies a series of programs were targeted at farmers the smithlever act of 1914 created the modern system of agricultural extension agents sponsored by the state agricultural colleges the agents taught new techniques to farmers the 1916 federal farm loan act provided for issuance of low-cost long-term mortgages to farmers[142]
child labor was curtailed by the keatingowen act of 1916 but the us supreme court declared it unconstitutional in 1918 no major child labor prohibition would take effect until the 1930s[143]
mexican revolution in october&#1601913 when mexico's president victoriano huerta summarily dissolved the mexican congress wilson withdrew diplomatic recognition in an attempt to isolate him globally using a policy called watchful waiting[144] this attempt appeared to be succeeding with britain and germany for example until wilson removed an embargo on the shipment of arms to huertas opposition the constitutionalists led by venustiano carranza this was considered too destabilizing and strengthened support for the existing government[145] wilson defended his action we are the friends of constitutional governmentbecause in no other way can our neighbors work out their own development in peace and liberty wilson appeared to contradict himself soon after telling the british ambassador that political stability in mexico could only be achieved when a fair distribution of land was carried out wilson's ambiguity led to his being misunderstood and even mocked in regard to the matter[144] after a us naval crew was briefly detained at tampico disagreements intensified wilson received approval from the congress to use military force if needed and later ordered an occupation of vera cruz incorrectly assuming there would be little opposition in fact the action resulted in fatalities126 mexicans and 19 americansand wilson's reputation as a statesman suffered severely for a time both at home and abroad[146]
his miscalculation may well have resulted from his wife ellen's failing health at the time which weighed heavily upon him wilson gladly accepted the offer of the so-called abc powersargentina brazil and chileto mediate the mexican dispute with the negotiations prolonged in niagara falls under mounting pressure huerta fled to spain and a month later carranza victoriously entered mexico city though the administration had achieved the desired result it was a pyrrhic victory as carranza's lieutenant pancho villa presented a more serious threat in 1916[147]
miners strike wife's death and remarriage in a 1914 dispute between colorado miners and their company a confrontation resulted in the ludlow massacrethe deaths of eight strikers eleven children and two mothers part owner john d rockefeller jr refused wilson's offer of mediation conditioned upon collective bargaining so wilson sent in us troops while wilson succeeded in bringing order to the situation and demonstrated support for the labor union the miners' unconditional surrender to the implacable owners was a defeat for wilson[148]
wilson's second wife edith bolling his wife ellen's failing health due to kidney failure worsened in the spring of 1914 after a fall she was bedridden then rallied briefly but wilson wrote my dear one grows weaker and weaker with a pathetic patience and sweetness he was at her bedside to the end which came august&#1606 when wilson despairingly said oh my god what am i to do wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression of course you know what has happened to megod has stricken me almost beyond what i can bear six months of depression followed for him though mourning continued at the same time that wilson's private world shattered world war i broke out in europe and this momentously changed his political life[149]
in january&#1601915 wilson emerged from his depression during a spirited speech in indianapolis where he said the trouble with the republican party is that it has not had a new idea for thirty years the republican party is still a covert and a refuge for those who are afraid for those who want to consult their grandfathers about everything[150] another sign of wilsons emotional restoration was the aggressiveness with which he pursued passage of a ship-purchase bill to bulk up the inadequately equipped merchant marine this lasted until march&#1601915 when he moderated drew back from the bill and without its passage congratulated the congress for its work in the session just endedhis initial journey through mourning was evident[151]
in february&#1601915 wilson had met edith bolling galt an attractive southern widow and jeweler after several meetings he fell in love and in may wilson proposed he was rebuffed initially but wilson was undeterred and the courtship continued[152] edith initially did not pursue the furtherance of their physical interaction with the vigor of wilson but she gradually warmed to the relationship and they became secretly engaged in the fall of 1915[153] many in wilson's camp had become concerned about the appearance of a premature romance soon after the death of his wife the engagement was made public in october and they were married on december&#16018[154]
world war i 19141916 from 1914 until early 1917 wilson's primary objective was to keep america out of the war in europe and his policy was the true spirit of neutrality which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned[155] wilson addressed the congress in 1914 such divisions amongst us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation not as a partisan but as a friend[156] he made numerous offers to mediate and sent colonel house on diplomatic missions however the allies and the central powers dismissed the overtures wilson even thought it counterproductive to comment on atrocities by either side this led to assertions of heartlessness on his part[157] republicans led by theodore roosevelt criticized wilson's refusal to build up the us army in anticipation of war but wilson retained the support of the peace element including women and the religious

wilson made his final offer to mediate peace on december&#16018 1916 as a preliminary he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security the central powers replied that victory was certain and the allies required the dismemberment of their enemies' empires no desire for peace existed and the offer lapsed[169]

wilson had earlier downplayed germany's as guilt in starting the war by calling for peace without victory but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty's treatment of germany[227] in a reversal of his earlier position in summer 1919 wilson repeatedly stressed germany's guilt saying the treaty seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history the wrong which germany sought to do to the world and to civilization and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment she attempted an intolerable thingand she must be made to pay for the attempt[228]
wilson had a series of debilitating strokes and had to cut short his trip on september&#16026 1919 he became an invalid in the white house closely monitored by his wife who insulated him from negative news and downplayed for him the gravity of his condition[229] senator lodge led the opposition to the treaty in the republican controlled senate the key point of disagreement was whether the league would diminish the power of congress to declare war
it proved possible to build a majority for the treaty in the senate but the two-thirds coalition needed to ratify was insurmountable[230] one block of democrats strongly supported the versailles treaty a second group supported the treaty but followed wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations the largest bloclodge and the republicanswanted a treaty with reservations especially on article x which empowered the league of nations to make war without a vote by the united states congress finally a bipartisan group of 13 irreconcilables opposed a treaty in any form[231] in mid-november&#1601919 lodge and his republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty democrats and were close to a two-thirds majority for a treaty with reservations but the seriously indisposed wilson rejected this compromise and enough democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification cooper and bailey suggest that wilson's stroke in september had debilitated him from negotiating effectively with lodge[232]
post war 19191920 wilson's administration did effectively demobilize the country at the war's end a plan to form a commission for the purpose was abandoned in the face of republican control the senate which complicated the appointment of commission members instead wilson favored the prompt dismantling of wartime boards and regulatory agencies[233] demobilization was chaotic and violent four million soldiers were sent home with little planning little money few benefits and other vague promises a wartime bubble in prices of farmland burst leaving many farmers deeply in debt after they purchased new land major strikes in the steel coal and meatpacking industries disrupted the economy in 1919[234] racial animosity erupted in serious race riots of ethnic whites against blacks in chicago omaha and two dozen other major cities in the north[235]
as the election of 1920 approached wilson momentarily imagined that a deadlocked democratic convention might nominate him for a third term with a campaign focused on the league of nations no one around the president adequately clarified for him that he was too incapacitated had insufficient support and that the league defeat was irreversible[236] in retirement wilson harbored hopes for a white house run in 1924 despite the absence of substantial support[237]
other foreign affairs wilson frequently intervened in latin american affairs saying in 1913 i am going to teach the south american republics to elect good men[238] these interventions included mexico in 1914 haiti dominican republic in 1916 cuba in 1917 and panama in 1918 the us maintained troops in nicaragua throughout the wilson administration and used them to select the president of nicaragua and then to force nicaragua to pass the bryan-chamorro treaty american troops in haiti under the command of the federal government forced the haitian legislature to choose as haitian president the candidate wilson selected[239] wilson ordered the military occupation of the dominican republic shortly after the resignation of its president juan isidro jimenes pereyra in 1916 the us military worked in concert with wealthy dominican landowners to suppress the gavilleros a campesino guerrilla force fighting the occupation the occupation lasted until 1924 and was notorious for its brutality against those in the resistance[240] wilson also negotiated a treaty with colombia in which the us apologized for its role in the panama revolution of 19031904[241]
after russia left world war i following the bolshevik revolution of 1917 the allies sent troops there to prevent a german or bolshevik takeover of allied-provided weapons munitions and other supplies previously shipped as aid to the pre-revolutionary government[242] wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of czechoslovak legions along the trans-siberian railway and to hold key port cities at arkangel and vladivostok though specifically instructed not to engage the bolsheviks the us forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new russian government revolutionaries in russia resented the american intrusion as robert maddox puts it the immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society[243] wilson withdrew most of the soldiers on april&#1601 1920 though some remained until as late as 1922
in 1919 wilson guided american foreign policy to acquiesce in the balfour declaration without supporting zionism in an official way wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of jews especially in poland and in france[244]
in may&#1601920 wilson sent a long-deferred proposal to congress to have the us accept a mandate from the league of nations to take over armenia[245] bailey notes this was opposed by american public opinion[246] while richard g hovannisian states that wilson made all the wrong arguments for the mandate and focused less on the immediate policy than on how history would judge his actions [he] wished to place it clearly on the record that the abandonment of armenia was not his doing[247] the resolution won the votes of only 23 senators
incapacity the immediate cause of wilson's incapacity in september&#1601919 was the physical strain of the public speaking tour he undertook in support of ratification of the treaty of versailles in pueblo colorado on september&#16025 1919 he collapsed and never fully recovered[248]
on october&#1602 1919 he suffered a serious stroke leaving him paralyzed on his left side and with only partial vision in the right eye[249] he was confined to bed for weeks and sequestered from everyone except his wife and physician dr cary grayson[250] for some months he used a wheelchair and later he required use of a cane his wife and aide joe tumulty were said to have helped a journalist louis seibold present a false account of an interview with the president[251]
he was insulated by his wife who selected matters for his attention and delegated others to his cabinet wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings[252] by february&#1601920 the president's true condition was public many expressed qualms about wilson's fitness for the presidency at a time when the league fight was reaching a climax and domestic issues such as strikes unemployment inflation and the threat of communism were ablaze no one including his wife his physician or personal assistant was willing to take upon themselves responsibility for the certification required by the constitution of his inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office[253] this complex case became a motivation for passage of the 25th amendment[254]
woman's suffrage wilson favored woman suffrage at the state level but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided with the south opposing an amendment on the grounds of state's rights in any case the only southern state to give its women the vote was arkansas the national woman's party (nwp) in 1917-1919 launched a highly visible campaign attacking wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment wilson however kept in close touch with the much larger and more moderate suffragists of the national american woman suffrage association he continued to hold off until he was sure the democratic party in the north was supportive the 1917 referendum in new york state in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him in january&#1601918 wilson went in person to the house and made a strong and widely published appeal to the house to pass the bill it passed but the senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification[255] behn argues that
the national american woman suffrage association not the national womans party was decisive in wilsons conversion to the cause of the federal amendment because its approach mirrored his own conservative vision of the appropriate method of reform win a broad consensus develop a legitimate rationale and make the issue politically valuable additionally i contend that wilson did have a significant role to play in the successful congressional passage and national ratification of the 19th amendment[256] civil rights several historians have criticized a number of wilson's policies on racial grounds[257][258][259][260][261][262] according to critics wilson believed that slavery was wrong on economic labor grounds rather than for moral reasons[262] they also argue that he idealized the slavery system in the south viewing masters as patient with indolent slaves[262] in terms of reconstruction they argue that wilson held the common southern view that the south was demoralized by northern carpetbaggers and that overreach on the part of the radical republicans justified extreme measures to reassert democratic national and state governments[263][264]
wilson's war department drafted hundreds of thousands of blacks into the army giving them equal pay with whites but in accord with military policy from the civil war through the second world war kept them in all-black units with white officers and kept the great majority out of combat[265] when a delegation of blacks protested the discriminatory actions wilson told them segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen in 1918 w e b du boisa leader of the naacp who had campaigned for wilsonwas offered an army commission in charge of dealing with race relations dubois accepted but he failed his army physical and did not serve[266]
while president of princeton university wilson had discouraged blacks from applying for admission preferring to keep the peace among white students and alumni[267] wilson's history of the american people (1901) explained the ku klux klan of the late 1860s as a lawless reaction to a lawless period wilson wrote that the klan began to attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the ballot or by any ordered course of public action[268]
cabinet heads appointed by president wilson re-segregated restrooms and cafeterias in their buildings wilson showed the film birth of a nation in the white house the film praised the ku klux klan and portrayed blacks as uncouth and uncivilized wilson who did not know the nature of the film beforehand never praised the film and considered it to be a very unfortunate production[269] during wilson's term the government began requiring photographs of all applicants for federal jobs he told black leaders that he sincerely believed this was in their interest[270]
