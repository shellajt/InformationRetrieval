v t e george washington (february 22 1732 [os february 11 1731][note 1][note 2]&#160� december 14 1799) was the first president of the united states (1789�97) the commander-in-chief of the continental army during the american revolutionary war and one of the founding fathers of the united states he presided over the convention that drafted the current united states constitution and during his lifetime was called the father of his country[4]
widely admired for his strong leadership qualities washington was unanimously elected president in the first two national elections he oversaw the creation of a strong well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the french revolutionary wars suppressed the whiskey rebellion and won acceptance among americans of all types[5] washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today such as the cabinet system the inaugural address and the title mr president[6][7] his retirement from office after two terms established a tradition which was unbroken until 1940
born into the provincial gentry of colonial virginia his family were wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves which he inherited he owned hundreds of slaves throughout his lifetime but his views on slavery evolved in his youth he became a senior british officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the french and indian war in 1775 the second continental congress commissioned washington as commander-in-chief of the continental army in the american revolution in that command washington forced the british out of boston in 1776 but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost new york city after crossing the delaware river in the middle of winter he defeated the british in two battles retook new jersey and restored momentum to the patriot cause this is known as the battle of trenton
his strategy enabled continental forces to capture two major british armies at saratoga in 1777 and yorktown in 1781 historians laud washington for the selection and supervision of his generals preservation and command of the army coordination with the congress with state governors and their militia and attention to supplies logistics and training in battle however washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by british generals with larger armies after victory had been finalized in 1783 washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to american republicanism[8]
washington presided over the constitutional convention in 1787 which devised a new form of federal government for the united states following unanimous election as president in 1789 he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation he supported alexander hamilton's programs to satisfy all debts federal and state established a permanent seat of government implemented an effective tax system and created a national bank[9] in avoiding war with great britain he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the jay treaty in 1795 despite intense opposition from the jeffersonians although he remained nonpartisan never joining the federalist party he largely supported their policies washington's farewell address was an influential primer on republican virtue warning against partisanship sectionalism and involvement in foreign wars he retired from the presidency in 1797 returning to his home and plantation at mount vernon
while in power his use of national authority pursued many ends especially the preservation of liberty reduction of regional tensions and promotion of a spirit of american nationalism[10] upon his death washington was eulogized as first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen by henry lee[11] revered in life and in death scholarly and public polling consistently ranks him among the top three presidents in american history he has been depicted and remembered in monuments currency and other dedications to the present day

early life (1732�1753) further information ancestry of george washington washington's birthplace the first child of augustine washington (1694�1743) and his second wife mary ball washington (1708�1789) george washington was born on their pope's creek estate near present-day colonial beach in westmoreland county virginia according to the julian calendar and annunciation style of enumerating years then in use in the british empire washington was born on february 11 1731 the gregorian calendar adopted in the british empire in 1752 rendered a birth date of february 22 1732[12][note 1][note 2]
washington was of primarily english gentry descent especially from sulgrave england his great-grandfather john washington emigrated to virginia in 1657 and began accumulating land and slaves as did his son lawrence and his grandson george's father augustine augustine was a tobacco planter who also tried his hand in iron-mining ventures[13] in george's youth the washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the virginia gentry of middling rank rather than one of the leading planter families[14] at this time virginia and other southern colonies had become a slave society in which slaveholders formed the ruling class and the economy was based upon slave labor[15]
six of george's siblings reached maturity including two older half-brothers lawrence and augustine from his father's first marriage to jane butler washington and four full siblings samuel elizabeth (betty) john augustine and charles three siblings died before adulthood his full sister mildred died when she was about one his half-brother butler died in infancy[16] and his half-sister jane died aged of twelve when george was about two[17] his father died when george was eleven years old and his half-brother lawrence became a surrogate father and role model william fairfax lawrence's father-in-law and cousin of virginia's largest landowner thomas lord fairfax was also a formative influence
washington spent much of his boyhood at ferry farm in stafford county near fredericksburg lawrence washington inherited another family property from his father a plantation on the potomac river which he named mount vernon in honor of his commanding officer admiral edward vernon george inherited ferry farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired mount vernon after lawrence's death[18]
arms of george washington[19] the death of his father prevented washington from an education at england's appleby school as his older brothers had received he achieved the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors as well as from school run by an anglican clergyman in or near fredericksburg[20][21] talk of securing an appointment in the royal navy for him when he was 15 was dropped when his widowed mother objected[22] thanks to lawrence's connection to the powerful fairfax family at age 17 in 1749 washington was appointed official surveyor for culpeper county a well-paid position which enabled him to purchase land in the shenandoah valley the first of his many land acquisitions in western virginia thanks also to lawrence's involvement in the ohio company a land investment company funded by virginia investors and lawrence's position as commander of the virginia militia washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of virginia robert dinwiddie washington was hard to miss at exactly six feet he towered over most of his contemporaries[23]
in 1751 washington traveled to barbados with lawrence who was suffering from tuberculosis with the hope that the climate would be beneficial to lawrence's health washington contracted smallpox during the trip which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease[24] however lawrence's health failed to improve and he returned to mount vernon where he would die in 1752[25] lawrence's position as adjutant general (militia leader) of virginia was divided into four offices after his death washington was appointed by governor dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in february 1753 with the rank of major in the virginia militia[26] during this period washington became a freemason while in fredericksburg although his involvement was minimal[27]
french and indian war (or 'seven years' war' 1754�1758) main article george washington in the french and indian war see also military career of george washington battle of jumonville glen battle of fort necessity and forbes expedition washington's map accompanying his journal to the ohio (1753�1754) the ohio company was an important vehicle through which british investors planned to expand into the ohio valley opening new settlements and trading posts for the indian trade[28] in 1753 the french themselves began expanding their military control into the ohio country a territory already claimed by the british colonies of virginia and pennsylvania these competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the french and indian war (1754�62) and contributed to the start of the global seven years' war (1756�63) by chance washington became involved in its beginning
robert dinwiddie lieutenant governor of colonial virginia was ordered by the british government to guard the british territorial claims including the ohio river basin in late 1753 dinwiddie ordered washington to deliver a letter asking the french to vacate the ohio valley[28] he was eager to prove himself as the new adjutant general of the militia appointed by the lieutenant governor himself only a year before during his trip washington met with tanacharison (also called half-king) and other iroquois chiefs allied with england at logstown to secure their support in case of a military conflict with the french�indeed washington and tanacharison became friends he delivered the letter to the local french commander jacques legardeur de saint-pierre who politely refused to leave[29] washington kept a diary during his expedition which was printed by william hunter on dinwiddie's order and which made washington's name recognizable in virginia[30] this increased notoriety helped him to obtain a commission to raise a company of 100 men and start his military career[31]
dinwiddie sent washington back to the ohio country to safeguard an ohio company's construction of a fort at present-day pittsburgh pennsylvania however before he reached the area a french force drove out colonial traders and began construction of fort duquesne a small detachment of french troops led by joseph coulon de jumonville was discovered by tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day uniontown pennsylvania on may 28 1754 washington and some of his militia unit aided by their mingo allies ambushed the french in what has come to be called the battle of jumonville glen exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes that jumonville was killed and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner whether jumonville died at the hands of tanacharison in cold blood or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with washington or by another means is not completely clear[32][33] he was given the epithet town destroyer by tanacharison[34]
the french responded by attacking and capturing washington at fort necessity in july 1754[35] however he was allowed to return with his troops to virginia historian joseph ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated washington's bravery initiative inexperience and impetuosity[36] these events had international consequences the french accused washington of assassinating jumonville who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission[36] both france and great britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to north america in 1755 war was formally declared in 1756[37]
braddock disaster 1755 main article braddock expedition in 1755 washington became the senior american aide to british general edward braddock on the ill-fated braddock expedition this was the largest british expedition to the colonies and was intended to expel the french from the ohio country the first objective was the capture of fort duquesne[38] washington initially sought from braddock an appointment as a major but upon advice that no rank above captain could be given except by london he agreed to serve as a staff volunteer during the passage of the expedition washington fell ill with severe headaches and fever nevertheless when the pace of the troops continued to slow washington recommended to braddock that the army be split into two divisions � a primary and more lightly but adequately equipped flying column offensive which could move at a more rapid pace to be followed by a more heavily armed reinforcing division braddock accepted the recommendation (likely made in a council of war including other officers) and took command of the lead division[39][40]
in the battle of the monongahela the french and their indian allies ambushed braddock's reduced forces and the general was mortally wounded after suffering devastating casualties the british panicked and retreated in disarray however washington rode back and forth across the battlefield rallying the remnants of the british and virginian forces into an organized retreat in the process despite his lingering illness he demonstrated much bravery and stamina�he had two horses shot from underneath him while his coat was pierced with four bullets in his report washington chiefly blamed the disaster on the conduct of the redcoats while praising that of the virginia contingent whatever responsibility rested on him for the defeat as a result of his recommendation to braddock washington was not included by the succeeding commander col thomas dunbar in planning subsequent force movements[41]
commander of virginia regiment lt governor dinwiddie rewarded washington in 1755 with a commission as colonel of the virginia regiment and commander in chief of all forces now raised in the defense of his majesty's colony and gave him the task of defending virginia's frontier the virginia regiment was the first full-time american military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the british regular units) washington was ordered to act defensively or offensively as he thought best[42] while washington happily accepted the commission the coveted redcoat of a british officer as well as the accompanying pay continued to elude him dinwiddie as well pressed in vain for the british military to incorporate the virginia regiment into its ranks[43]
in command of a thousand soldiers washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training he led his men in brutal campaigns against the indians in the west in 10 months his regiment fought 20 battles and lost a third of its men washington's strenuous efforts meant that virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies ellis concludes it was his only unqualified success in the war[44][45]
in 1758 washington participated in the forbes expedition to capture fort duquesne he was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another british unit thought the other was the french enemy and opened fire with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition and the british scored a major strategic victory gaining control of the ohio valley when the french abandoned the fort following the expedition he retired from his virginia regiment commission in december 1758 washington did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775[46]
lessons learned although washington never gained the commission in the british army he yearned for in these years the young man gained valuable military political and leadership skills[47][48] he closely observed british military tactics gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the revolution washington learned to organize train drill and discipline his companies and regiments from his observations readings and conversations with professional officers he learned the basics of battlefield tactics as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics[49] he gained an understanding of overall strategy especially in locating strategic geographical points[50]
he demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations including disasters and retreats he developed a command presence�given his size strength stamina and bravery in battle he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question[51][52] however washington's fortitude in his early years was sometimes manifested in less constructive ways biographer john r alden contends washington offered fulsome and insincere flattery to british generals in vain attempts to win great favor and on occasion showed youthful arrogance as well as jealousy and ingratitude in the midst of impatience[53]
historian ron chernow is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results[47] other historians tend to ascribe washington's position on government to his later american revolutionary war service[note 3] he developed a very negative idea of the value of militia who seemed too unreliable too undisciplined and too short-term compared to regulars[54] on the other hand his experience was limited to command of at most 1000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the revolution at boston new york trenton and philadelphia[55]
between the wars mount vernon (1759�1774) a mezzotint of martha washington based on a 1757 portrait by wollaston washington expanded the estate at mount vernon after his marriage on january 6 1759 washington married the wealthy widow martha dandridge custis then 28 years old surviving letters suggest that he may have been in love at the time with sally fairfax the wife of a friend[56] nevertheless george and martha made a compatible marriage because martha was intelligent gracious and experienced in managing a planter's estate[57]
together the two raised her two children from her previous marriage john parke custis and martha parke custis later the washingtons raised two of mrs washington's grandchildren eleanor parke custis and george washington parke custis george and martha never had any children together�his earlier bout with smallpox in 1751 may have made him sterile[58][59] the newlywed couple moved to mount vernon near alexandria where he took up the life of a planter and political figure
washington's marriage to martha greatly increased his property holdings and social standing and made him one of virginia's wealthiest men he acquired one-third of the 18000-acre (73&#160km2) custis estate upon his marriage worth approximately $100000 and managed the remainder on behalf of martha's children for whom he sincerely cared[60]
in 1754 lieutenant governor dinwiddie had promised land bounties to the soldiers and officers who volunteered to serve during the french and indian war[61] lord botetourt the new governor finally fulfilled dinwiddie's promise in 1769�1770[61][62] with washington subsequently receiving title to 23200 acres (94&#160km2) where the kanawha river flows into the ohio river in what is now western west virginia[63] he also frequently bought additional land in his own name by 1775 washington had doubled the size of mount vernon to 6500 acres (26&#160km2) and had increased its slave population to over 100 as a respected military hero and large landowner he held local office and was elected to the virginia provincial legislature representing frederick county in the house of burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758[64][note 4]
washington at age 40 (1772) washington lived an aristocratic lifestyle�fox hunting was a favorite leisure activity[65] he also enjoyed going to dances and parties in addition to the theater races and cockfights washington also was known to play cards backgammon and billiards[66] like most virginia planters he imported luxuries and other goods from england and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop[67]
washington began to pull himself out of debt in the mid-1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco-centric business interests into other ventures[67] and paying more attention to his affairs[68] in 1766 he started switching mount vernon's primary cash crop away from tobacco to wheat a crop that could be processed and then sold in various forms in the colonies and further diversified operations to include flour milling fishing horse breeding spinning weaving and (in the 1790s) whiskey production[67] patsy custis's death in 1773 from epilepsy enabled washington to pay off his british creditors since half of her inheritance passed to him[69]
a successful planter he was a leader in the social elite in virginia from 1768 to 1775 he invited some 2000 guests to his mount vernon estate mostly those he considered people of rank as for people not of high social status his advice was to treat them civilly but keep them at a proper distance for they will grow upon familiarity in proportion as you sink in authority[70] in 1769 he became more politically active presenting the virginia assembly with legislation to ban the importation of goods from great britain[71]
american revolution (1775�1783) main articles george washington in the american revolution and military career of george washington washington opposed the 1765 stamp act the first direct tax on the colonies imposed by the english parliament which included no representatives from the colonies he began taking a leading role in the growing colonial resistance when protests against the townshend acts (enacted in 1767) became widespread in may 1769 washington introduced a proposal drafted by his friend george mason calling for virginia to boycott english goods until the acts were repealed[72] parliament repealed the townshend acts in 1770 however washington regarded the passage of the intolerable acts in 1774 as an invasion of our rights and privileges[73] washington told friend bryan fairfax i think the parliament of great britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than i have to put my hands into yours for money he also said that americans must not submit to acts of tyranny till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway[74]
in july 1774 he chaired the meeting at which the fairfax resolves were adopted which called for the convening of a continental congress among other things in august washington attended the first virginia convention where he was selected as a delegate to the first continental congress[75][76]
commander in chief charles willson peale (american 1741-1827) george washington 1776 oil on canvas brooklyn museum after the battles of lexington and concord near boston in april 1775 the colonies went to war washington appeared at the second continental congress in a military uniform signaling that he was prepared for war[77] washington had the prestige military experience charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot virginia the largest colony deserved recognition and new england�where the fighting began�realized it needed southern support washington did not explicitly seek the office of commander and said that he was not equal to it[78][79] but there was no serious competition[80] congress created the continental army on june 14 1775[81] nominated by john adams of massachusetts washington was then appointed as a full general and commander-in-chief[78][82][83] the british then articulated the peril of washington and his army�on august 23 1775 britain issued a royal proclamation labeling american rebels as traitors if they resorted to force they faced confiscation of their property their leaders were subject to execution upon the scaffold[84]
general george washington at trenton by john trumbull yale university art gallery (1792) general washington essentially assumed three roles during the war first in 1775�77 and again in 1781 he provided leadership of troops against the main british forces although he lost many of his battles he never surrendered his army during the war and he continued to fight the british relentlessly until the war's end he plotted the overall strategy of the war in cooperation with congress[85]
secondly he was charged with organizing and training the army he recruited regulars and assigned baron von steuben a veteran of the prussian general staff to train them the war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of congress[86] but washington pressured the congress to provide the essentials[87] in june 1776 congress' first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as board of war and ordnance succeeded by the board of war in july 1777 a committee which eventually included members of the military[86] the command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of congressional appointees (and congress sometimes made those appointments without washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks and of all of the militia-officers the results of his general staff were mixed as some of his favorites (like john sullivan) never mastered the art of command[85]
eventually he found capable officers such as general nathanael greene general daniel morgan - the old wagoner that he had served with in the french and indian war colonel henry knox - chief of artillery and colonel alexander hamilton - chief-of-staff the american officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles the great successes at boston (1776) saratoga (1777) and yorktown (1781) came from trapping the british far from base with much larger numbers of troops[85] daniel morgan's annihilation of banastre tarleton's legion of dragoons at cowpens in february 1781 came as a result of morgan's employment of superior line tactics against his british opponent resulting in one of the very few double envelopments in military history another being hannibal's defeat of the romans at cannae in 216 bc the decisive defeat of col patrick ferguson's tory regiment at king's mountain demonstrated the superiority of the riflery of american over mountain men over british-trained troops armed with musket and bayonet these over-mountain men were led by a variety of elected officers including the 6'6 william campbell who had become one of washington's officers by the time of yorktown similarly morgan's virginia riflemen proved themselves superior to the british at saratoga a post-revolutionary war development being the creation of trained rifle battalions in the european armies
washington's third and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the crown�the representative man of the revolution his long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times and eventually this strategy worked his enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept congress the army the french the militias and the states all pointed toward a common goal furthermore by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won (rather than declaring himself monarch) he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs yet his constant reiteration of the point that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias (clearly demonstrated in the rout at camden where only the maryland and delaware continentals under baron dekalb held firm) helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army[88]
victory at boston washington taking control of the continental army 1775 washington assumed command of the continental army in the field at cambridge massachusetts in july 1775 during the ongoing siege of boston realizing his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder washington asked for new sources american troops raided british arsenals including some in the caribbean and some manufacturing was attempted they obtained a barely adequate supply (about 25&#160million pounds) by the end of 1776 mostly from france[89]
washington reorganized the army during the long standoff and forced the british to withdraw by putting artillery on dorchester heights overlooking the city the british evacuated boston in march 1776 and washington moved his army to new york city[90]
although highly disparaging toward most of the patriots british newspapers routinely praised washington's personal character and qualities as a military commander these articles were bold as washington was an enemy general who commanded an army in a cause that many britons believed would ruin the empire[91]
defeat at new york city and fabian tactics washington crossing the delaware december 25 1776 by emanuel leutze 1851 in august 1776 british general william howe launched a massive naval and land campaign designed to seize new york the continental army under washington engaged the enemy for the first time as an army of the newly independent united states at the battle of long island the largest battle of the entire war the americans were heavily outnumbered many men deserted and washington was badly beaten subsequently washington was forced to retreat across the east river at night he did so without loss of life or materiel[92] washington heeding greene's recommendation to attempt a defense of ft washington belatedly retreated further across the hudson to ft lee to avoid encirclement but thereby enabled howe to take the offensive and capture fort washington on november 16 with high continental casualties biographer alden opines that although washington was responsible for the decision to delay the patriots' retreat he tried to ascribe blame for the decision to defend fort washington to the wishes of congress and the bad advice of nathaniel greene[93]
washington then continued his flight across new jersey the future of the continental army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses[94] on the night of december 25 1776 washington staged a comeback with a surprise attack on a hessian outpost in western new jersey he led his army across the delaware river to capture nearly 1000 hessians in trenton new jersey washington followed up his victory at trenton with another over british regulars at princeton in early january the british retreated to new york city and its environs which they held until the peace treaty of 1783 washington's victories wrecked the british carrot-and-stick strategy of showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms the americans would not negotiate for anything short of independence[95] these victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate patriot victory however since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter washington and congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles[96]
in february 1777 while encamped at morristown new jersey washington became convinced that only smallpox inoculation would prevent the destruction of his army by using variolation washington ordered the inoculation of all troops and by some reports death by smallpox in the ranks dropped from 17% of all deaths to 1% of all reported deaths[97]47
historians debate whether or not washington preferred a fabian strategy[note 5] to harass the british with quick sharp attacks followed by a retreat so the larger british army could not catch him or whether he preferred to fight major battles[note 6] while his southern commander greene in 1780�81 did use fabian tactics washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777 after losing new york city and seeing much of his army melt away trenton and princeton were fabian examples by summer 1777 however washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations as at brandywine germantown monmouth and yorktown[98]
1777 campaigns in late summer of 1777 british general john burgoyne led a major invasion army south from quebec with the intention of splitting off rebellious new england but general howe in new york took his army south to philadelphia instead of going up the hudson river to join with burgoyne near albany�a major strategic mistake meanwhile washington rushed to philadelphia to engage howe while closely following the action in upstate new york where the patriots were led by general philip schuyler and his successor horatio gates the ensuing pitched battles at philadelphia were too complex for washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated at the battle of brandywine on september 11 1777 howe outmaneuvered washington and marched into the american capital at philadelphia unopposed on september 26 washington's army unsuccessfully attacked the british garrison at germantown in early october meanwhile to the north burgoyne beyond the reach of help from howe was trapped and forced to surrender after the battles of saratoga[99] this was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically�the french responded to burgoyne's defeat by entering the war allying with america and expanding the revolutionary war into a major worldwide affair
washington's loss at philadelphia prompted some members of congress to consider removing washington from command this movement termed the conway cabal failed after washington's supporters rallied behind him[100] biographer alden relates it was inevitable that the defeats of washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper new york should be compared the zealous admiration of washington indeed inevitably waned john adams (never a fan of the southern delegation to the continental congress) wrote congress will appoint a thanksgiving and one cause of it ought to be that the glory of turning the tide of arms is not immediately due to the commander-in-chief nor to southern troops if it had been idolatry and adulation would have been unboundednow we can allow a certain citizen to be wise virtuous and good without thinking him a deity or a savior[101]
valley forge main article valley forge general washington and lafayette look over the troops at valley forge washington's army of 11000[102] went into winter quarters at valley forge north of philadelphia in december 1777 over the next six months the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands (the majority being from disease)[103] with historians' death toll estimates ranging from 2000[103] to 2500[104][105] to over 3000 men[106] the next spring however the army emerged from valley forge in good order thanks in part to a full-scale training program supervised by general von steuben[107] the british evacuated philadelphia to new york in 1778[108] shadowed by washington washington attacked them at monmouth fighting to an effective draw in one of the war's largest battles[109] afterwards the british continued to head towards new york and washington moved his army outside of new york[108]
sullivan expedition main article sullivan expedition in the summer of 1779 washington and congress decided to strike the iroquois warriors of the six nations in a campaign to force britain's indian allies out of new york which they had used as a base to attack american settlements across new england[110] in june 1779 the warriors had joined with tory rangers led by colonel william butler using barbarities normally shunned slew over 200 frontiersmen and laid waste to the wyoming valley in pennsylvania indeed one british officer who witnessed the tory brutality said the redcoats on return to england would scalp every son of a bitch of them[111] in august of 1779 general john sullivan led a military operation that destroyed at least 40 iroquois villages burned all available crops few people were killed as the indians fled to british protection in canada sullivan later reported that �the immediate objects of this expedition are accomplished viz total ruin of the indian settlements and the destruction of their crops which were designed for the support of those inhuman barbarians[112]
hudson river and southern battles and a traitor washington at this time moved his headquarters from middlebrook to new windsor on the hudson with an army of 10000 the british led by howe's successor sir henry clinton made a move up the hudson against american posts at verplanck's point and stony point and both places succumbed but a counter-offensive by the patriots led by general anthony wayne was briefly successful clinton was in the end able to shut off kings ferry but it was a strategic loss - he could proceed no further up the river due to american fortifications and washington's army the skirmishes at verplanck's point and at stony point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale[113]
the winter of 1779�1780 when washington went into quarters at morristown represented the worst suffering for the army during the war the temperatures fell to 16 below zero the new york harbor was frozen over and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at valley forge[114] in late 1779 clinton moved his forces south to charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by benjamin lincoln after his success there clinton returned victorious to new york leaving cornwallis in the south congress replaced lincoln with gates despite washington's recommendation of greene when gates failed in south carolina he was then replaced by greene the british at the time seemed to have the south almost in their grasp despite this news washington was encouraged to learn in mid-1780 that lafayette had returned from france with additional naval assets and forces[114]
washington was shocked to learn of the treason of benedict arnold who had contributed significantly to the war effort embittered by his dealings with congress over rank and finances as well as the alliance with france arnold joined the british cause he conspired with the british in a plan to seize the post he commanded at west point washington just missed apprehending him but did capture his conspirator major john andre a british intelligence officer under clinton who was later hanged by order of a court-martial called by washington[115]
washington's army went into winter quarters at new windsor in 1780 and suffered again for lack of supplies there resulted a considerable mutiny by pennsylvania troops washington prevailed upon congress as well as state officials to come to their aid with provisions he very much sympathized with their suffering saying he hoped the army would continue to struggle under the same difficulties they have hitherto endured which i cannot help remarking seem to reach the bounds of human patience[116]
victory at yorktown general washington and the comte de rochambeau at yorktown virginia 1781 in july 1780 5000 veteran french troops led by the comte de rochambeau arrived at newport rhode island to aid in the war effort[117] french naval forces then landed led by admiral fran�ois joseph paul de grasse though it was washington's hope initially to bring the allied fight to new york and to end the war there de grasse was advised by rochambeau that cornwallis in virginia was the better target de grasse followed rochambeau's advice and arrived off the virginia coast washington immediately saw the advantage created made a feinting move with his force towards clinton in new york and then headed south to virginia[118]
washington's continental army also newly funded by $20000 in french gold delivered the final blow to the british in 1781 after a french naval victory allowed american and french forces to trap a british army in virginia preventing reinforcement by clinton from the north[119] the surrender at yorktown on october 19 1781 marked the end of major fighting in continental north america[120] cornwallis failed to appear at the official surrender ceremony and sent general charles oharrow as his proxy washington then assigned his role to benjamin lincoln of equal rank[121]
demobilization though substantial combat had ended the war had not and a formal treaty of peace was months away creating tension the british still had 26000 troops occupying new york city charleston and savannah together with a powerful fleet the french army and navy departed so the americans were on their own in 1782�83 money matters fed the anxiety�the treasury was empty and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive almost to the point of mutiny at one point the mutineers forced an adjournment of the congress from philadelphia to princeton washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the newburgh conspiracy in march 1783 and congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus[122]
general george washington resigning his commission by john trumbull capitol rotunda (commissioned 1817) with the initial peace treaty articles ratified in april a recently formed congressional committee under hamilton was considering needs and plans for a peacetime army on may 2 1783 the commander in chief submitted his sentiments on a peace establishment[123] to the committee essentially providing an official continental army position the original proposal was defeated in congress in two votes (may 1783 october 1783) with a truncated version also being rejected in april 1784[124]

washington later submitted a formal account of the expenses he had personally advanced the army over the eight year conflict of about $450000 it is said to have been detailed regarding small items vague concerning large ones and included the expenses incurred from martha's visits to his headquarters as well as his compensation for service none of which had been drawn during the war[129]
historian john shy says that by 1783 washington was a mediocre military strategist but had become a master political tactician with an almost perfect sense of timing and a developed capacity to exploit his charismatic reputation using people who thought they were using him[130]
constitutional convention scene at the signing of the us constitution by howard chandler christy 1940 main article constitutional convention (united states) washington's retirement to personal business at mount vernon was short-lived making an exploratory trip to the western frontier in 1784 he inspected his land holdings in western pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the french and indian war[78][131] there he confronted squatters including david reed and the covenanters who vacated but only after losing a court decision heard in washington pennsylvania in 1786[131]
after much reluctance he was persuaded to attend the constitutional convention in philadelphia during the summer of 1787 as a delegate from virginia where he was elected in unanimity as president of the convention[132] he held considerable criticism of the articles of confederation of the thirteen colonies for the weak central government it established referring to the articles as no more than a rope of sand to support the new nation[133] his participation in the debates was minor although he casted his vote when called upon his prestige facilitated the collegiality and productivity of the delegates after a couple of months into the task washington told alexander hamilton i almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business in the end agreements were hatched however and washington thought the achievement monumental[134]
following the convention his support convinced many but not all of his colleagues to vote for ratification he unsuccessfully lobbied patrick henry saying that the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the union is in my opinion desirable he declared that the only alternative would be anarchy nevertheless he did not consider it appropriate to cast his vote in favor of adoption for virginia since he was expected to be nominated president thereunder[135] the new constitution was subsequently ratified by all thirteen states[136] the delegates to the convention designed the presidency with washington in mind allowing him to define the office by establishing precedent once elected[137]
presidency (1789�1797) main article presidency of george washington lansdowne portrait painted by gilbert stuart in 1796 the electoral college unanimously elected washington as the first president in 1789[note 7] and again 1792[139] he remains the only president to receive the totality of electoral votes[note 8] john adams who received the next highest vote total was elected vice president on april 30 1789 washington was inaugurated taking the first presidential oath of office on the balcony of federal hall in new york city[140] the oath as follows was administered by chancellor robert r livingston �i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states� historian john r alden indicates that washington added the words so help me god[141]
the 1st united states congress voted to pay washington a salary of $25000 a year�a large sum in 1789 valued at about $340000 in 2015 dollars[note 9] washington despite facing financial troubles then initially declined the salary valuing his image as a selfless public servant at the urging of congress however he ultimately accepted the payment to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary[142] the president aware that everything he did set a precedent attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated european royal courts[note 10][143] to that end he preferred the title mr president to the more majestic names proposed by the senate[144]
washington proved an able administrator and established many precedents in the functions of the presidency including messages to congress and the cabinet form of government[7] despite fears that a democratic system would lead to political violence he set the standard for tolerance of opposition voices and conducted a smooth transition of power to his successor[6] an excellent delegator and judge of talent and character he talked regularly with department heads and listened to their advice before making a final decision[145] in handling routine tasks he was systematic orderly energetic solicitous of the opinion of others  but decisive intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions with them[146] after reluctantly serving a second term washington refused to run for a third establishing the tradition of a maximum of two terms for a president which was solidified by thomas jefferson and james madison[147]
domestic issues george washington by rembrandt peale de young museum (ca 1850) see also whiskey rebellion washington was not a member of any political party and hoped that they would not be formed fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism[148] his closest advisors formed two factions setting the framework for the future first party system secretary of treasury alexander hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and build a financially powerful nation and formed the basis of the federalist party secretary of the state thomas jefferson founder of the jeffersonian republicans strenuously opposed hamilton's agenda but washington typically favored hamilton over jefferson and it was hamilton's agenda that went into effect jefferson's political actions his support of philip freneau's national gazette[149] and his attempt to undermine hamilton nearly led george washington to dismiss jefferson from his cabinet[150] though jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again[150]
in early 1790 hamilton devised a plan with the approval of washington culminating in the residence act of 1790 that established the creditworthiness of the new government as well as its permanent location congress had previously issued almost $22 million in certificates of debt during the war to suppliers some of the states had incurred debt as well (more so in the north) in accordance with the plan congress authorized the assumption and payment of these debts and provided funding through customs duties and excise taxes the proposal was largely favored in the north and opposed in the south hamilton obtained the approval of the southern states in exchange for an agreement to place the new national capitol on the potomac river while the national debt increased as a result during hamilton's service as secretary of the treasury the nation established its good credit many in the congress and elsewhere in the government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed though many of washington's fellow virginians as well as others were vexed by this he considered they had adequate redress through their congressional representatives[151]
the revenue act authorized the president to select the specific location of the seat of the government on the potomac the president was to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for this seat washington personally oversaw this effort throughout his term in office in 1791 the commissioners named the permanent seat of government the city of washington in the territory of columbia to honor washington in 1800 the territory of columbia became the district of columbia when the federal government moved to the site according to the provisions of the residence act[152]
in 1791 partly as a result of the copper panic of 1789 congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits which led to protests in frontier districts especially pennsylvania by 1794 after washington ordered the protesters to appear in us district court the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the whiskey rebellion the federal army was too small to be used so washington invoked the militia act of 1792 to summon militias from pennsylvania virginia maryland and new jersey[153] the governors sent the troops with washington taking initial command he subsequently named henry lighthorse harry lee as field commander to lead the troops into the rebellious districts the rebels dispersed and there was no fighting as washington's forceful action proved the new government could protect itself this represented the premier instance of the federal government using military force to exert authority over the states and citizens[154] and is also the only time a sitting us president personally commanded troops in the field[155]
foreign affairs miniature portrait of washington by robert field (1800) in february 1793 the french revolutionary wars broke out between great britain and its allies and revolutionary france and engulfed europe until 1815 washington with cabinet approval proclaimed american neutrality the revolutionary government of france sent diplomat edmond-charles gen�t called citizen gen�t to america gen�t was welcomed with great enthusiasm and began promoting the case for france using a network of new democratic societies in major cities he even issued french letters of marque and reprisal to french ships manned by american sailors so they could capture british merchant ships washington denounced the societies and demanded the french government recall gen�t which they did[156]

farewell address main article george washington's farewell address washington's farewell address (september 19 1796) washington's farewell address (issued as a public letter in 1796) was one of the most influential statements of republicanism drafted primarily by washington himself with help from hamilton it gives advice on the necessity and importance of national union the value of the constitution and the rule of law the evils of political parties and the proper virtues of a republican people he referred to morality as a necessary spring of popular government and said whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle[162]

comparisons with cincinnatus during the revolutionary and early republican periods of american history many commentators compared washington with the roman aristocrat and statesman cincinnatus the comparison arose as washington like cincinnatus remained in command of the continental army only until the british had been defeated thereafter instead of seeking great political power he returned as quickly as possible to cultivating his lands[170][171] remarking on washington's resignation in december 1783 and his decision to retire to mount vernon poet philip freneau wrote thus he whom rome's proud legions sway'd/return'd and sought his sylvan shade[172] lord byron's ode to napoleon also lionized washington as the cincinnatus of the west[173]
